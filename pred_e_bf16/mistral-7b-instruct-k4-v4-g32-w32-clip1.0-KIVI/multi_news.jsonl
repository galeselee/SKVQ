He was also a significant philanthropist, particularly in African-American education and culture.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on African-American communities in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of more than 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him. These schools played a crucial role in the education of thousands of African-American children, including civil rights activist John Lewis and poet Maya Angelou.\n\nA new documentary, \"Rosenwald,\" tells the story of his little-known contributions to African-American culture and education.

Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The evidence presented includes the use of copper alloy fasteners, which were not common in ships of the 15th or 16th century, and the absence of iron and/or wood fixations that should have been present on the Santa Maria.\n\nThe initial discovery was made by US marine archaeologist Barry Clifford in May, who claimed that the geographical, underwater topography, and archaeological evidence strongly suggested that the wreck was Columbus' famous flagship, the Santa Maria. Clifford also pointed out a metallic tube at the site, which he believed to be a cannon.\n\nHowever, a team of experts led by the former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, Xavier Nieto Prieto, concluded that the fasteners found at the site indicated a technique of ship construction that dates the ship to the late 17th or 18th Century rather than the 15th or 16th Century.

The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham. The criminal neglect charges are still pending, though Sarah Markham's attorney—Mark O'Mara, who defended George Zimmerman—says he expects they will be dismissed now.

The meeting, which was held in a private setting with only the respective foreign ministers and translators present, was extended beyond its scheduled half-hour length. The meeting's format and tone were seen as a win for Putin, as it excluded key members of Trump's team who are more skeptical of Russia, such as National Security Advisor HR McMaster and Senior Russia Advisor Fiona Hill.\n\nThe meeting's agenda included discussions on Syria, Ukraine, and election hacking. While election hacking was raised during the meeting, it did not appear to be a top priority. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that an agreement had been reached to set up a working group on non-interference in future elections, although this move is unlikely to reassure those in Washington concerned about Russia's actions.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that Trump had told Putin he accepted the Russian leader's denials of involvement in the 2016 US presidential election. However, Trump's stance on this issue remains unclear, as he declined to say definitively whether he believes US intelligence officials who have stated that Russia interfered in the election.\n\nThe meeting was filmed and posted on the German government's official Facebook page. Ahead of the meeting, three US senators wrote to Trump expressing concern about reports that his administration planned to discuss the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York that were seized by the Obama administration in response to alleged Russian election meddling.\n\nTrump's meeting with Putin was one of several high-profile meetings during the G20 summit. He also met with leaders from Japan and South Korea to discuss North Korea's nuclear ambitions, and he is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Some, such as Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, praised Trump's speech in Warsaw in which he urged Russia to stop its \"destabilizing activities\" and end its support for Syria and Iran.\n\nHowever, others, such as Representative Adam Schiff, have expressed concern that Trump may be less prepared for his meeting with Putin than the Russian president, and that he may be too eager to find common ground with Putin.

Reuters notes that in addition to the handshake, Trump patted Putin on the arm and later on the back, and both men smiled.

{"pred": "In recent news, France has taken a significant step towards legalizing same-sex marriage and adoption rights for same-sex couples. The National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, approved the controversial bill, known as \"marriage for all,\" by a majority vote of 329 to 229. This legislation, a key election promise of President François Hollande, redefines marriage as a contract between two people rather than a union between a man and a woman.\n\nThe bill now moves to the Senate, or upper house, for approval on April 2, where it is expected to pass due to the left-wing majority. If passed, France will join 11 other countries, including Spain, Sweden, South Africa, and the Netherlands, in allowing same-sex marriages. The United States, with nine states and Washington D.C. having legalized same-sex marriage, and the United Kingdom, which recently voted for marriage equality, are also among the nations that support this reform.\n\nThe debate over the bill has been contentious, with over 5,000 amendments proposed by the conservative opposition to delay proceedings. The issue has divided the nation, particularly on the question of equal rights for children. While a majority of French citizens support same-sex marriage, less than half agree with equal rights for children.\n\nThe Catholic Church and other religious groups, such as Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists, have expressed concern over the draft bill. The Church has accused President Hollande of pushing through the legislation without proper consultation.
