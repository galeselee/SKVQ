He was also a significant philanthropist, particularly in African-American education and culture.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on African-American communities in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of more than 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him.

Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's body, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, a phenomenon known as superheating. This superheated ice can persist inside the fish for extended periods, even during summer warming episodes when temperatures rise above the expected melting point.\n\nThe researchers found that the ice crystals in the fish's body do not melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remain intact. This superheating is primarily due to the antifreeze protein, which binds to the ice crystals and alters their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or melt.\n\nThe long-term implications of this superheated ice are not yet clear, as it is unknown if there are any adverse effects on the fish's body. However, the researchers suggest that the spleen may be trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThe discovery of superheating in notothenioid fishes provides a better understanding of the progression of all species and highlights the idea that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences may also arise.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has declined dramatically, with the November 2013 estimate of 378,000 tons being the lowest in more than a decade and far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline is causing concern among scientists and environmental groups, who fear that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if sardines do not recover soon.\n\nThe reasons for the decline are unclear, but one factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm.\n\nThe PFMC has already slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups argue that the catch should be halted outright to prevent further decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, but the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is also causing concern for the health of other marine species. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013. Research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious alternatives, producing less milk for their young.\n\nForage fish, such as sardines, account for more", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

Newhouse argues that the temporary convention bounces for both candidates will not alter the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency due to the struggling economy. He points to the high unemployment rates, the large number of Americans struggling to find work, and the increasing number of people on food stamps as key issues that will determine the election's outcome.\n\nRomney is proving to be more competitive in more states than anticipated, with a close race in several swing states such as Wisconsin and New Mexico.

The campaign's grassroots effort is also unprecedented, with volunteers knocking on more doors and making more phone calls than during the entire 2008 campaign.\n\nOn the other hand, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a potential withdrawal in North Carolina, a state won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008.

The adviser also criticized the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling for putting \"chum in the water for the media\" and accused the media and the Obama campaign of trying to get Republicans depressed.\n\nAccording to a poll tracking model created for HuffPost Pollster, the conventions have boosted Obama's share of the vote", "answers": ["Mitt Romney's campaign was scrambling yesterday to reverse any impression that the candidate might be slipping into election oblivion.

During a Q&A session, audience members voiced concerns about the film's depiction of African Americans and its handling of homosexuality.\n\nCritics have particularly taken issue with the comedy's treatment of homosexuality, as the plot revolves around Ferrell's character's fear of being raped in prison, with scenes involving a gay man. The Guardian criticized the film for its negative portrayal of homosexuality, while Variety deemed it as \"one of the ugliest gay-panic humor to befoul a studio release in recent memory.\"\n\nProducers and stars of the film, including Ferrell and Hart, have defended the comedy as a satire of stereotypes rather than a representation of them. They argue that the characters are meant to reflect existing attitudes and misconceptions in society. However, the film's marketing team has been left cursing the negative attention, which has been amplified by headlines in The Los Angeles Times and other media outlets.\n\nMeanwhile, in the tech world, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of all outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. are inappropriate. This translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, with most of these being for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses. The majority of these prescriptions are for acute respiratory conditions, with half of them being unnecessary.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts have identified this overuse of antibiotics as a major contributor to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs. These superbugs pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. In 2013, the CDC published a report outlining the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., stating that each year in the U.S., at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and at least 23,000 people die.\n\nThe studies suggest that better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing. However, the numbers provided in the reports likely undercount the actual extent of antibiotic prescribing due to exclusions of prescriptions written over the phone, at urgent care clinics, retail pharmacies, dentists' offices, and by nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nThe White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar systems produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm). West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity needs from the grid during summer peak demand by 65%, compared to the 54% reduction achieved by south-facing panels.\n\nThe study suggests that west-facing panels are more effective due to homeowners' lifestyles, as they capture solar energy late in the afternoon, a time when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, thus optimizing solar power generation during the surge in usage and peak demand. Additionally, less electricity generated by west-facing panels will be unused and sent back into the grid, making it easier for utility companies to manage.\n\nThe study has the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, as it opens up the market to homeowners with east-west roof pitches who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar. Homeowners may also be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during summer months, and the overall outcome during winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes, remains uncertain. The study has not been released publicly, but it has been shared with National Geographic News.\n\nThe findings of the Pecan Street study are not entirely new, as a California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load compared to south-facing ones.

His teeth, both front and back, were heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and using them as tools.

The directive authorizes the use of offensive cyber attacks in foreign nations without their government's consent, as well as the drawing up of a list of potential cyber targets overseas.\n\nThe meeting between Obama and Xi was significant as both leaders had not yet had detailed talks on cybersecurity, one of the most contentious bilateral issues.

The study found that for approximately 20% of patients, or 40,000 women annually in the United States, the removal of cancerous nodes does not improve survival, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or change the treatment plan. This procedure, which has been performed for over a century, can cause complications such as infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling in the arm.\n\nThe study included 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. After the initial node biopsy, the patients were randomly assigned to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. The results showed no difference in survival between the two groups, with over 90% surviving at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1%.\n\nThe study's findings are part of a trend towards less radical surgery for breast cancer, as the understanding of the disease evolves. In the past, it was believed that surgery could eradicate the cancer before it could spread. However, research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery. The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors and use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.\n\nThe study's results do not apply to all patients, only to those whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study.

By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans.

{"pred": "In the news, there are three main stories about Antarctica's rapidly increasing ice melt and its impact on global sea levels.\n\n1. Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost annually since 2012, according to a study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since the last assessment in 2012 and is causing global sea levels to rise by 0.6mm annually. The losses are primarily occurring in the West of Antarctica, where warm waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the land rises due to isostatic readjustment, it can actually constrain ice losses, but only temporarily. Ocean warming is expected to make the ice too thin for this process to help.\n\n3. An international team of ice experts, working with NASA and the European Space Agency, released a study showing that Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992. This melting has caused the oceans to rise by about three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). The study, which looked at ice loss in 24 different ways using multiple satellites, ground, and air measurements, found that West Antarctica, where most of the melting occurred, is in a state of collapse. The study also found that East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice a year, but it was gaining ice before 2012.\n\nThese studies highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctic ice melt as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal communities. The latest assessments suggest that Antarctica is becoming a significant player in global sea-level rise, with the potential to contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century.", "answers": ["Scientists monitoring ice loss in Antarctica have chilling news: The melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year, according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal Nature.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The church has been releasing historical documents and clarifying sensitive tenets in an effort to fill a void on the Internet and prevent current members from leaving, as well as to show non-Mormons that the faith has nothing to hide. The stone will remain in the church's vault, but the pictures are intended to help people better understand the religion's roots.\n\nThe Book of Mormon was translated from the gold plates in just three months in 1829, a process that is still not fully understood. The church acknowledges that the Lord may have intentionally left the details of the translation process vague to keep it in the realm of faith. The translation involved physical instruments, including the Urim and Thummim, a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim, and a seer stone, a small oval stone that Joseph Smith discovered before he retrieved the gold plates. Witnesses of the translation process recorded that when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English.\n\nThe translation of the Book of Mormon was a monumental task, as Joseph was asked to render an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages. The process involved multiple phases, with Joseph growing and developing his role as he went along. The original Book of Mormon manuscript, which has survived through the years, supports statements that Joseph dictated the text from another language in a short period of time.\n\nJoseph Smith was not alone in the translation process. He was assisted by faithful individuals who believed in the Book of Mormon and were willing to put up with hard work and later trial and hardship. Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher, was the primary scribe for the original manuscript, but many others, including Martin Harris, Emma Smith, Samuel Smith, Reuben Hale, Christian Whitmer, John Whitmer, and an unidentified scribe, also took up a quill to assist Joseph.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has been translated into more than 110", "answers": ["To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time.

The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune.

The Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada, located near Las Vegas, protects a scenic and ecologically fragile area, including rock art, artifacts, rare fossils, and dinosaur tracks.\n\nThe designations were met with opposition from state Republican leaders and rural residents who argue that it adds another layer of unnecessary federal control and closes the area to new energy development. Utah's attorney general vowed to sue, and Sen. Mike Lee tweeted that the designation was an \"arrogant act\" that would not stand.\n\nIn response, President-elect Donald Trump's administration rushed to safeguard vulnerable areas ahead of his inauguration, blocking new mining claims outside Yellowstone National Park and new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Trump's upcoming presidency has tempered the excitement of tribal leaders and conservationists, with some worrying he could try to reverse or reduce some of Obama's expansive land protections.\n\nIn a significant turn of events, President Donald Trump signed two presidential proclamations on December 4, 2017, shrinking the size of Bears Ears National Monument by more than 80% and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by roughly 45%.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources.

The first story discusses the ongoing issues with overcrowding, unstable weather, and geography on Everest, which were highlighted by a recent incident where at least four climbers did not make it back from their ascent. This event occurred during a time when more than 300 climbers were attempting to reach the summit, creating a human traffic jam. Another significant event was the decision by Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience (Himex), one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, to cancel his climb and return home due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening climbers, abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face, and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season.\n\nThe second story focuses on the risks and fatalities faced by Sherpas, ethnic Nepalese people who work as high-altitude climbing guides on Everest. A study comparing the fatality rates of various professions found that the death rate for climbing Sherpas on Everest from 2004 to 2014 was 12 times higher than the death rate for U.S. military personnel deployed in Iraq from 2003-07. This year, an avalanche on April 18th resulted in the deaths of 16 Sherpas, making it the worst climbing accident in Everest's history. The job remains dangerous for Sherpas due to factors such as lack of access to bottled oxygen, prophylactic dexamethasone, and heavy lifting responsibilities, which require them to spend more time on the most dangerous parts of the mountain.\n\nDespite the risks, many Sherpas continue to work on Everest due to the economic opportunities it provides, with wages ranging from two to eight thousand dollars at the conclusion of an expedition. However, after the recent avalanche, Sherpas have demanded increased compensation for families of the deceased, increased insurance benefits, and other changes to improve their working conditions.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The show initially had a pop-culture focus, but it evolved to satirize hard news and the conventions of news reporting.\n   - In 1998, Kilborn left the show to host a late-night talk show on CBS, and Jon Stewart was hired as his replacement. Stewart brought a new direction to the show, focusing on political satire and a more pointed, purposeful approach.\n   - The early days of Stewart's tenure were marked by tension with some of the holdover writers from the Kilborn era. Stewart hired Ben Karlin as head writer, who brought a higher quotient of righteous anger to the show's jokes.\n   - Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent on The Daily Show during the Kilborn era, returned to the show as a regular contributor. Colbert's subversive style and trustworthy appearance proved to be a perfect fit for the show's new direction.\n   - Other notable correspondents include Steve Carell, Mo Rocca, and Nancy Walls Carell. Carell's character was inspired by a local news anchor who had been demoted to a cable news show.\n   - The show's field pieces initially focused on eccentric and oddball characters, but Stewart encouraged the correspondents to target politicians and the media instead.
