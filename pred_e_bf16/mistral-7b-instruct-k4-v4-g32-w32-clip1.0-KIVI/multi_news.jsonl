He was also a significant philanthropist, particularly in African-American education and culture.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on African-American communities in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of more than 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him.

Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's body, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, a phenomenon known as superheating. This superheated ice can persist inside the fish for extended periods, even during summer warming episodes when temperatures rise above the expected melting point.\n\nThe researchers found that the ice crystals in the fish's body do not melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remain intact. This superheating is primarily due to the antifreeze protein, which binds to the ice crystals and alters their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or melt.\n\nThe long-term implications of this superheated ice are not yet clear, as it is unknown if there are any adverse effects on the fish's body. However, the researchers suggest that the spleen may be trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThe discovery of superheating in notothenioid fishes provides a better understanding of the progression of all species and highlights the idea that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences may also arise.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has declined dramatically, with the November 2013 estimate of 378,000 tons being the lowest in more than a decade and far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline is causing concern among scientists and environmental groups, who fear that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if sardines do not recover soon.\n\nThe reasons for the decline are unclear, but one factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm.\n\nThe PFMC has already slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups argue that the catch should be halted outright to prevent further decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, but the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is also causing concern for the health of other marine species. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013. Research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious alternatives, producing less milk for their young.\n\nForage fish, such as sardines, account for more", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

Newhouse argues that the temporary convention bounces for both candidates will not alter the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency due to the struggling economy. He points to the high unemployment rates, the large number of Americans struggling to find work, and the increasing number of people on food stamps as key issues that will determine the election's outcome.\n\nRomney is proving to be more competitive in more states than anticipated, with a close race in several swing states such as Wisconsin and New Mexico.

The campaign's grassroots effort is also unprecedented, with volunteers knocking on more doors and making more phone calls than during the entire 2008 campaign.\n\nOn the other hand, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a potential withdrawal in North Carolina, a state won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008.

The adviser also criticized the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling for putting \"chum in the water for the media\" and accused the media and the Obama campaign of trying to get Republicans depressed.\n\nAccording to a poll tracking model created for HuffPost Pollster, the conventions have boosted Obama's share of the vote", "answers": ["Mitt Romney's campaign was scrambling yesterday to reverse any impression that the candidate might be slipping into election oblivion.

During a Q&A session, audience members voiced concerns about the film's depiction of African Americans and its handling of homosexuality.\n\nCritics have particularly taken issue with the comedy's treatment of homosexuality, as the plot revolves around Ferrell's character's fear of being raped in prison, with scenes involving a gay man. The Guardian criticized the film for its negative portrayal of homosexuality, while Variety deemed it as \"one of the ugliest gay-panic humor to befoul a studio release in recent memory.\"\n\nProducers and stars of the film, including Ferrell and Hart, have defended the comedy as a satire of stereotypes rather than a representation of them. They argue that the characters are meant to reflect existing attitudes and misconceptions in society. However, the film's marketing team has been left cursing the negative attention, which has been amplified by headlines in The Los Angeles Times and other media outlets.\n\nMeanwhile, in the tech world, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of all outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. are inappropriate. This translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, with most of these being for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses. The majority of these prescriptions are for acute respiratory conditions, with half of them being unnecessary.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts have identified this overuse of antibiotics as a major contributor to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs. These superbugs pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. In 2013, the CDC published a report outlining the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., stating that each year in the U.S., at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and at least 23,000 people die.\n\nThe studies suggest that better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing. However, the numbers provided in the reports likely undercount the actual extent of antibiotic prescribing due to exclusions of prescriptions written over the phone, at urgent care clinics, retail pharmacies, dentists' offices, and by nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nThe White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar systems produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm). West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity needs from the grid during summer peak demand by 65%, compared to the 54% reduction achieved by south-facing panels.\n\nThe study suggests that west-facing panels are more effective due to homeowners' lifestyles, as they capture solar energy late in the afternoon, a time when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, thus optimizing solar power generation during the surge in usage and peak demand. Additionally, less electricity generated by west-facing panels will be unused and sent back into the grid, making it easier for utility companies to manage.\n\nThe study has the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, as it opens up the market to homeowners with east-west roof pitches who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar. Homeowners may also be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during summer months, and the overall outcome during winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes, remains uncertain. The study has not been released publicly, but it has been shared with National Geographic News.\n\nThe findings of the Pecan Street study are not entirely new, as a California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load compared to south-facing ones.

His teeth, both front and back, were heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and using them as tools.

The directive authorizes the use of offensive cyber attacks in foreign nations without their government's consent, as well as the drawing up of a list of potential cyber targets overseas.\n\nThe meeting between Obama and Xi was significant as both leaders had not yet had detailed talks on cybersecurity, one of the most contentious bilateral issues.

The study found that for approximately 20% of patients, or 40,000 women annually in the United States, the removal of cancerous nodes does not improve survival, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or change the treatment plan. This procedure, which has been performed for over a century, can cause complications such as infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling in the arm.\n\nThe study included 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. After the initial node biopsy, the patients were randomly assigned to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. The results showed no difference in survival between the two groups, with over 90% surviving at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1%.\n\nThe study's findings are part of a trend towards less radical surgery for breast cancer, as the understanding of the disease evolves. In the past, it was believed that surgery could eradicate the cancer before it could spread. However, research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery. The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors and use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.\n\nThe study's results do not apply to all patients, only to those whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study.

By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans.

{"pred": "In the news, there are three main stories about Antarctica's rapidly increasing ice melt and its impact on global sea levels.\n\n1. Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost annually since 2012, according to a study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since the last assessment in 2012 and is causing global sea levels to rise by 0.6mm annually. The losses are primarily occurring in the West of Antarctica, where warm waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the land rises due to isostatic readjustment, it can actually constrain ice losses, but only temporarily. Ocean warming is expected to make the ice too thin for this process to help.\n\n3. An international team of ice experts, working with NASA and the European Space Agency, released a study showing that Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992. This melting has caused the oceans to rise by about three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). The study, which looked at ice loss in 24 different ways using multiple satellites, ground, and air measurements, found that West Antarctica, where most of the melting occurred, is in a state of collapse. The study also found that East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice a year, but it was gaining ice before 2012.\n\nThese studies highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctic ice melt as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal communities. The latest assessments suggest that Antarctica is becoming a significant player in global sea-level rise, with the potential to contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century.", "answers": ["Scientists monitoring ice loss in Antarctica have chilling news: The melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year, according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal Nature.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The church has been releasing historical documents and clarifying sensitive tenets in an effort to fill a void on the Internet and prevent current members from leaving, as well as to show non-Mormons that the faith has nothing to hide. The stone will remain in the church's vault, but the pictures are intended to help people better understand the religion's roots.\n\nThe Book of Mormon was translated from the gold plates in just three months in 1829, a process that is still not fully understood. The church acknowledges that the Lord may have intentionally left the details of the translation process vague to keep it in the realm of faith. The translation involved physical instruments, including the Urim and Thummim, a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim, and a seer stone, a small oval stone that Joseph Smith discovered before he retrieved the gold plates. Witnesses of the translation process recorded that when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English.\n\nThe translation of the Book of Mormon was a monumental task, as Joseph was asked to render an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages. The process involved multiple phases, with Joseph growing and developing his role as he went along. The original Book of Mormon manuscript, which has survived through the years, supports statements that Joseph dictated the text from another language in a short period of time.\n\nJoseph Smith was not alone in the translation process. He was assisted by faithful individuals who believed in the Book of Mormon and were willing to put up with hard work and later trial and hardship. Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher, was the primary scribe for the original manuscript, but many others, including Martin Harris, Emma Smith, Samuel Smith, Reuben Hale, Christian Whitmer, John Whitmer, and an unidentified scribe, also took up a quill to assist Joseph.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has been translated into more than 110", "answers": ["To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time.

The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune.

The Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada, located near Las Vegas, protects a scenic and ecologically fragile area, including rock art, artifacts, rare fossils, and dinosaur tracks.\n\nThe designations were met with opposition from state Republican leaders and rural residents who argue that it adds another layer of unnecessary federal control and closes the area to new energy development. Utah's attorney general vowed to sue, and Sen. Mike Lee tweeted that the designation was an \"arrogant act\" that would not stand.\n\nIn response, President-elect Donald Trump's administration rushed to safeguard vulnerable areas ahead of his inauguration, blocking new mining claims outside Yellowstone National Park and new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Trump's upcoming presidency has tempered the excitement of tribal leaders and conservationists, with some worrying he could try to reverse or reduce some of Obama's expansive land protections.\n\nIn a significant turn of events, President Donald Trump signed two presidential proclamations on December 4, 2017, shrinking the size of Bears Ears National Monument by more than 80% and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by roughly 45%.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources.

The first story discusses the ongoing issues with overcrowding, unstable weather, and geography on Everest, which were highlighted by a recent incident where at least four climbers did not make it back from their ascent. This event occurred during a time when more than 300 climbers were attempting to reach the summit, creating a human traffic jam. Another significant event was the decision by Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience (Himex), one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, to cancel his climb and return home due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening climbers, abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face, and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season.\n\nThe second story focuses on the risks and fatalities faced by Sherpas, ethnic Nepalese people who work as high-altitude climbing guides on Everest. A study comparing the fatality rates of various professions found that the death rate for climbing Sherpas on Everest from 2004 to 2014 was 12 times higher than the death rate for U.S. military personnel deployed in Iraq from 2003-07. This year, an avalanche on April 18th resulted in the deaths of 16 Sherpas, making it the worst climbing accident in Everest's history. The job remains dangerous for Sherpas due to factors such as lack of access to bottled oxygen, prophylactic dexamethasone, and heavy lifting responsibilities, which require them to spend more time on the most dangerous parts of the mountain.\n\nDespite the risks, many Sherpas continue to work on Everest due to the economic opportunities it provides, with wages ranging from two to eight thousand dollars at the conclusion of an expedition. However, after the recent avalanche, Sherpas have demanded increased compensation for families of the deceased, increased insurance benefits, and other changes to improve their working conditions.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The show initially had a pop-culture focus, but it evolved to satirize hard news and the conventions of news reporting.\n   - In 1998, Kilborn left the show to host a late-night talk show on CBS, and Jon Stewart was hired as his replacement. Stewart brought a new direction to the show, focusing on political satire and a more pointed, purposeful approach.\n   - The early days of Stewart's tenure were marked by tension with some of the holdover writers from the Kilborn era. Stewart hired Ben Karlin as head writer, who brought a higher quotient of righteous anger to the show's jokes.\n   - Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent on The Daily Show during the Kilborn era, returned to the show as a regular contributor. Colbert's subversive style and trustworthy appearance proved to be a perfect fit for the show's new direction.\n   - Other notable correspondents include Steve Carell, Mo Rocca, and Nancy Walls Carell. Carell's character was inspired by a local news anchor who had been demoted to a cable news show.\n   - The show's field pieces initially focused on eccentric and oddball characters, but Stewart encouraged the correspondents to target politicians and the media instead.

The plant has experienced multiple reactor failures, with at least three reactors experiencing partial meltdowns. The situation is so severe that it has been rated at least as bad as the Three Mile Island incident in 1979, and Japan has raised the severity rating to level 5 on the INES international scale.\n\nEngineers are working tirelessly to prevent a catastrophic radiation release by restoring power to the plant's cooling systems. They are laying additional cabling and attempting to connect an external transmission line to the plant. If successful, this would allow them to restart the water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods. Experts believe that this would be a significant step forward in establishing stability at the plant.\n\nHowever, the situation remains critical, and there is a risk that the fuel rods may heat up and spew radiation if they are not fully covered with water. If the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns, which would release much larger amounts of radioactive material.\n\nThe crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life. Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. The Japanese government has established a 12-mile evacuation zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors. The U.S. government, however, has recommended a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens.\n\nThe crisis has also triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices, sent shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and led to power shortages in Japan, forcing auto and other factories to close. The U.S. has offered Japan any help it can provide, and President Barack Obama has ordered a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear plants in the United States.\n\nThe crisis has been compounded by the fact that the Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, leaving many people confused and anxious.

These smaller bodies have orbits that appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet, a \"massive perturber.\"\n\nPlanet Nine's discovery could reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto, which was the iconic ninth planet for three-quarters of a century, was demoted to a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006, largely due to Brown's observations of the outer solar system. Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" has been working on finding a new planet to make amends with Pluto fans, including his daughter.\n\nNASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has expressed excitement about the new research but cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system. Green emphasized the need for extraordinary evidence to support extraordinary claims.\n\nIf Planet Nine exists, it would be the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, with a diameter about two to four times that of Earth. However, due to its extreme distance, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object. Confirmation of its existence would require direct observation, and Brown puts the odds of Planet Nine being real as \"maybe 90 percent.\" If and when it's spotted, it will be evaluated based on the criteria set by the International Astronomical Union, which could potentially reinstate Pluto as a planet if Planet Nine meets the necessary requirements.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant event in astronomy, as it would provide insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.

Damascus: The city, once known for its vibrant nightlife and all-night party scene, is now experiencing a significant transformation due to the war. Traffic is frequently disrupted, and people are wary of venturing out after dark due to increased kidnappings and violence. The city is under military lockdown, with checkpoints and soldiers searching vehicles for weapons. Basic necessities such as gasoline, food, and heating oil are becoming increasingly scarce, and the winter season is causing concern among residents.\n\n2. Alawite minority: Tensions are rising within Syria's Alawite minority, which has traditionally supported President Bashar al-Assad. Whispers of intrigue and strains within the Assad clan suggest that the Alawites may be questioning their loyalty to the regime. The Alawites fear being relegated to second-class status or even being targeted for revenge by Sunnis if the rebels were to win. However, there is no indication that the Alawites are planning to switch sides to join the opposition.\n\n3. Economy: The ongoing conflict is taking a toll on Syria's economy, with factories being burned down or damaged, international sanctions restricting finances, and inflation rising to at least 36%. The currency has dropped around 50% in value, and fuel shortages have become widespread. The economic blow has been hard, but Assad has been able to keep his head above water with financial support from Iran. However, the question remains whether this support is sustainable in the long term.\n\n4. Rebel attacks: Syrian activists report that a string of government airstrikes on rebel areas in the country's north has killed at least 20 people and leveled buildings. The regime has increasingly relied on air power as the rebels have improved their fighting capabilities on the ground. Rebels have also blown up oil and gas pipelines in the northeast near the Iraqi border.\n\n5.

Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the US, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-Western militias. More from Syria: The rebels today blew up one oil pipeline and one gas pipeline near Deir al-Zour, the AP reports, citing state media. Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions.

The spacecraft, launched in 2006, has traveled 3 billion miles and will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto's surface at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT). The mission could provide valuable insights about Earth's history, including how it formed, where Earth's water came from, how life began on Earth, Earth's atmospheric structure, and how the sun affects Earth.\n\nPluto, a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, is the last world in the solar system to be visited by a spacecraft. It was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006 because it does not dominate its region of space in the way the other major planets do. The New Horizons mission will take scores of photographs as it speeds past Pluto and its five known moons, providing the first close-up view of the mountains and valleys of the unknown world, and its tenuous atmosphere.\n\nThe spacecraft will take 16 months to send all the data it collects back to Earth, as it will take 4.5 hours for data to travel between Pluto and Earth. The most dangerous hazards for New Horizons are dust particles trapped in orbit around Pluto after being dislodged from its moons by meteorite impacts. A strike from a dust particle the size of a grain of rice could destroy the spacecraft, but the risk of such a disaster is low.\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft has seven sophisticated instruments on board, including cameras, spectrometers, and a plasma instrument. It also carries the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930. The spacecraft has already beamed back the best-ever images of Pluto and its moon Charon, and the data it collects during the flyby will provide a wealth of information about Pluto's composition, atmosphere, and geology.\n\nThe New Horizons mission is a collaborative project that is an extension of the 2016 End of Term project", "answers": ["This is one of the biggest days in the exploration of our solar system since Voyager 2 approached Neptune in 1989—and there may not be a day like it again.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

However, the focus on big-budget films has made it difficult for smaller films to be produced, as studios are prioritizing films with the potential for multiple revenue streams.\n\nJohn Waters, a well-known filmmaker, shares his frustration with the current state of filmmaking, as he has been unable to secure funding for his films due to the focus on low-budget films under $2 million. David Lynch, another renowned filmmaker, has not directed a feature film since 2006 and expresses hope that the arthouse will return to prominence. The mid-budget adult-oriented motion picture has all but disappeared, and many filmmakers are turning to television as an alternative.\n\nThe shift in the film industry over the past decade and a half has been attributed to the increasing costs of marketing films, which often exceed production budgets. Studios are now prioritizing big-budget films with the potential for large returns, relegating smaller films to the indie scene, where resources are limited. This has led to a decrease in the number of studio films being produced, but an increase in the number of independent films. However, the increased competition in the indie scene makes it difficult for filmmakers to find distribution and audiences.\n\nThe lack of funding for mid-budget films has led many filmmakers to turn to television, where they can find more opportunities for storytelling and a larger audience.

Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom.

This discrepancy between the new measurements and the expansion rate predicted from observations of the Big Bang afterglow collected by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite presents a challenge for scientists.\n\nThe new measurements were made by refining the distance measurements to faraway galaxies using Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae.

The team then compared these distances with the expansion of space as measured by the stretching of light from receding galaxies to calculate the rate of universal expansion.\n\nThe discrepancy between the new measurements and the predictions based on the Big Bang afterglow observations could be due to several reasons. One possibility is that dark energy, which is known to be accelerating the universe, may be pushing galaxies apart with even greater vigor than scientists believed.

The event aims to bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions to improve the breast pump experience. The hackathon is inspired by the lack of innovation in breast pumps, which are often loud, have too many parts, are hard to clean, and are embarrassing to use. The health benefits of breastfeeding are numerous, but many women do not breastfeed or wean after several months, particularly low-income, working women who may not have access to private rooms for pumping during the workday. The breast pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum, as women are encouraged to pursue their careers while still honoring the wisdom that \"breast is best.\" The hackathon is free to attend, and tickets are now full.\n\nIn May 2014, a group of five researchers at MIT hosted a mini hackathon to explore ideas for improving the breast pump. At that event, ideas ranged from integrating robotics into breast pumps to lowering the cost on a global scale and impacting policy to ensure women have better access to private rooms for pumping during the workday. Possible innovations include smarter interfaces and guided experiences, data collection, and discreet, hands-free breast pumps.\n\nIn addition to the hackathon, there are several ongoing projects aimed at improving the breast pump experience.

The animated film Finding Dory continued its success with the biggest third weekend of all time for an animated movie, but the live-action films The Legend of Tarzan and The BFG underperformed. The BFG, a film adaptation of Roald Dahl's popular children's novel, earned $24 million on a $140 million budget, indicating a reliance on its overseas performance. The film's poor performance is surprising given its high-profile director, Steven Spielberg, and the movie's positive reviews and audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe BFG tells the story of an orphan girl named Sophie who befriends a friendly giant named the BFG. The film received praise for Mark Rylance's performance as the BFG and the special effects, but critics felt that the movie didn't go beyond being a pretty picture. The film was released during a crowded summer schedule, and its title may have been confusing for American audiences who are not as familiar with Dahl's work.\n\nThe BFG's poor performance at the box office has led to speculation about the future of children's book adaptations and Spielberg's directorial career. However, it is important to note that The BFG's failure is not necessarily indicative of a larger trend, as the film did not twist the original material beyond recognition and the adaptation was not a disaster. Spielberg is currently working on another book adaptation, Ready Player One, which stars Mark Rylance and has the potential to be successful.\n\nIn addition to the news about The BFG, there was also news about the Internet Archive's efforts to archive web pages and preserve links to the versions of pages that were live when the page was written.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio.

This increased risk brings the absolute risk up to 1 in 10. The study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council and published in BMJ Open, involved 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had been bereaved. In addition to the increased risk of suicide attempt, those bereaved by suicide were also 80% more likely to drop out of education or work, with 8% of the people bereaved by suicide having dropped out of an educational course or a job since the death.\n\nThe study's author, Dr Alexandra Pitman, emphasized that while the results highlight the profound impact that suicide can have on friends and family members, the outcomes are not inevitable. Dr Pitman stated that support is available for those bereaved by suicide and encouraged people to seek help. The study also found that people who had been bereaved by suicide tended to perceive more social stigma around the death.

They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65% more likely to attempt suicide themselves (what NDTV refers to as the phenomenon of \"suicide contagion\") than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes—or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release.

And the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person's outlook. \"Suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject,\" Pitman notes. \"Avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized, and sometimes even blamed for the death.\" That's not to say, though, that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate. \"These outcomes are by no means inevitable,\" Pitman says. \"If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available.\" (A Marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 5691}

His poll numbers suffered as Trump surged to the top of the field, and Walker's own lackluster performance in the first debate and a series of missteps on immigration reform and birthright citizenship also contributed to his decline.\n\nIn addition to financial difficulties, Walker's campaign was also plagued by organizational problems. Duane Cottingham, an Iowa political activist who supported Walker's efforts in the caucus state, criticized the campaign for failing to mobilize grassroots support and organize effectively.\n\nWalker's exit from the race is likely to set off a scramble for his big-money backers, led by the Ricketts family, one of the GOP's most powerful financial contributors.

The practice of plural marriage led to the birth of many children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes, shaped 19th-century Mormon society, and helped create a sense of cohesion among the community.\n\nPlural marriage was introduced incrementally and participants were asked to keep their participation confidential. The practice was controversial and violated cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and revilement. However, many later testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them accept this practice.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not fully documented due to its confidential nature and the passage of time. The historical record is thin, with many details unknown. The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented, but some ambiguity will always accompany our knowledge about this issue.\n\nJoseph Smith, the founder of the Latter-day Saints, married multiple wives and introduced the practice to close associates. He received a revelation commanding him to practice plural marriage in 1831, which was part of a larger revelation about eternal marriage. The sealing of husband and wife for eternity was made possible by the restoration of priesthood keys and ordinances.\n\nPlural marriage was practiced in Nauvoo, Illinois, and continued in Utah until 1890 when Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, declaring his intention to submit to the anti-polygamy laws passed by the U.S. government. The Manifesto led to the end of plural marriage in the Church, but a small number of plural marriages continued to be performed in Mexico and Canada until the Second Manifesto was issued in 1904, making new plural marriages punishable by excommunication.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was a trial of faith for many who practiced it, but it also benefited the Church in numerous ways.

Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\").

US infrastructure is often run by creaky systems that were previously offline, which kept them relatively safe.

The study, which tracked the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes among California high school seniors, found that the combined rate of e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 was higher than the rate of cigarette use in 2004, suggesting that e-cigarettes are not merely substituting for cigarettes.\n\nThe second article, also published in Pediatrics, reports on a study that found that adolescents who reported e-cigarette use had more than six times the odds of initiating cigarette use as never e-cigarette users. The study suggests that e-cigarette use in never-smoking youth may increase the risk of subsequent initiation of cigarettes and other combustible products during the transition to adulthood when the purchase of tobacco products becomes legal.\n\nThe third article, from WebMD, provides an overview of e-cigarettes, explaining how they work and discussing the debate among health experts about whether they are safer than traditional cigarettes or a high-tech way to hook a new generation on nicotine.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies.

The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014).

This finding challenges the notion that only humans use different sides of their brains to distinguish different aspects of sound.\n\nThe study, published in Frontiers of Neuroscience, suggests that this asymmetrical sound processing in both human and bat brains makes evolutionary sense. In humans, the slower timing of the right hemisphere allows for identifying who is speaking, gauging emotional state via tone-of-voice, and teasing out pitch in music, which is thought to be important for coordinating group activities and forming cultures. For mustached bats, the need for this asymmetry is even more compelling as they need to use the fast timing of the left hemisphere to distinguish communication sounds from each other, and the slow timing of the right hemisphere to use sonar to track the velocity of the fast-moving insects they eat.\n\nThe study also found that this asymmetric sampling in bats is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females, which is consistent with humans. Women tend to use both the left and right hemispheres for language, but men largely use just the left hemisphere.

{"pred": "The news summarized in the provided passages discuss the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which caused extensive flooding in Houston, Texas, and the potential role of climate change in intensifying the storm. The news reports highlight the immediate response of ordinary people organizing rescue efforts, but also raise concerns about the long-term challenges posed by the storm, particularly in terms of funding for recovery and the role of climate change in increasing the risk of such disasters.\n\nThe first issue that will test the nation's unity is funding the recovery from the storm. The cost of damages from previous disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and early estimates for Harvey's damages are also expected to be in the billions. In recent years, Congress has faced partisan divides over funding for disaster relief, with some members proposing to offset aid with cuts to other programs.\n\nThe second issue is the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of such devastating storms. Scientists agree that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future. The water in the Gulf of Mexico was nearly 2 degrees warmer than normal during Harvey, and warmer water fuels hurricanes. Several studies show that the top 1% of the strongest downpours are already happening more frequently, and calculations show that the rainfall received by Rockport, Texas, used to be a once-in-1,800-years event but is now a once-every-300-years event due to warmer air holding more water and changes in storm steering currents since 2010.\n\nThere is ongoing debate among climate scientists over the role of global warming in causing Harvey to stall over Texas, which was a factor in the catastrophic flooding. Some theorize that there is a connection between melting sea ice in the Arctic and changes in the jet stream and weather patterns that make \"blocking fronts\" more common. Others contend it's too early to say.\n\nThe news also highlights the politicization of the storm by some media outlets, with Fox News criticizing CNN for asking about the effect of climate change on the storm's intense rainfall. Fox accused CNN of using the crisis to drive a political narrative, despite the fact that Fox was also politic", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map.

That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Three of these matches were at Wimbledon. The TIU was given evidence in 2008, but no new investigations were opened due to legal advice that previous corruption offences could not be pursued. The TIU has a full-time staff of only five and relies on intelligence from players and betting companies to alert them to potential corruption. The European Sports Security Association, which monitors betting for leading bookmakers, flagged up more than 50 suspicious matches to the TIU in 2015, declaring that tennis attracts more suspicious gambling activity than other sports. Eight of the players repeatedly flagged to the TIU over the past decade are due to play in the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, 18 January. The TIU has been criticized for not having enough resources and for a lack of transparency in its investigations.

Among the accusations: Corrupt gamblers have contacted players in their hotels and offered them $50,000 or more to fix a match. Gambling syndicates in Russia and Italy then placed \"highly suspicious bets on scores of matches—including at Wimbledon and the French Open,\" says Buzzfeed.

The Obama administration portrayed the released Iranians as civilians convicted of sanctions-related offenses, but a recent investigation by Politico reveals that some of these individuals were accused by the Obama Justice Department of posing threats to national security. Three of the released individuals were part of an illegal procurement network that supplied Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics, which have applications in surface-to-air and cruise missiles. Another individual was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology and hardware. The Obama administration also dropped their demand for $10 million that a jury said the aerospace engineer illegally received from Tehran. Additionally, the Justice Department dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of them fugitives. These individuals were accused of procuring U.S. military antennas, which were used in IEDs that killed U.S. military personnel in Iraq, and high-tech components for an especially deadly type of IED used by Shiite militias. The Obama administration did not disclose the names or details of the charges against these individuals, noting only that the U.S. \"also removed any Interpol red notices and dismissed any charges against 14 Iranians for whom it was assessed that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful.\" The investigation suggests that the Obama administration undermined its own non-proliferation efforts and American national security by releasing these individuals in order to secure the Iran nuclear deal. The Trump administration has pledged to review the Iran deal and the Iranians' compliance with it, which could reveal the extent to which the Obama administration compromised national security for a short-term foreign policy win.

The device, which uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), was tested on four patients aged 24 to 76 who had been diagnosed with CLIS for more than a year. The patients were trained to think \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to simple questions, and the device learned to distinguish the blood flow patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient.\n\nAfter training, the patients were asked more personal questions, including questions about their quality of life. Surprisingly, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with life, suggesting that CLIS might not be the living hell many presume it to be. However, not all answers went down well, as one patient's daughter asked whether she should marry her boyfriend, to which the father said \"no\" nine times out of ten.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Plos Biology, is a significant breakthrough as it is the first time reliable communication has been established with completely locked-in patients.

He believes that if the findings can be replicated in a larger group of patients, fNIRS may be the answer to finding a portable, cost-effective, and reliable means for communicating with patients who are entirely physically non-responsive.\n\nThe study's most surprising outcome was that these patients reported being \"happy\" despite being physically locked-in and incapable of expressing themselves on a day-to-day basis, challenging preconceived notions about what we might think if the worst were to happen.

Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

The State Department would see a 28% cut, or $10 billion.\n\nThe budget eliminates the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, low-income heating assistance, and the AmeriCorps national service program.

It seemed as though he survived on energy drinks and caffeine pills.” Here's one assessment of the six-page article: \"After reading Seal’s piece, I’m convinced that Oscar Pistorius is kind of a jerk,\" writes Justin Peters at Slate. \"But while the piece definitely nudges the reader toward the conclusion that he murdered Steenkamp, it hasn’t cleared up all reasonable doubt.\" Read the Vanity Fair piece in full."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9525}
{"pred": "On July 22, 2015, Bowe Bergdahl, the controversial U.S. soldier who was released in a prisoner exchange after being held captive by the Taliban in Afghanistan, was unexpectedly present during a marijuana raid in Mendocino County, California. Bergdahl was visiting friends in the area and was not involved in the drug operation. He was treated as a witness and released after a field interview. Sheriff Thomas Allman confirmed that Bergdahl was indeed in Mendocino County on the day of the raid, and he was above politeness as several people from the home where he was visiting were taken into custody. Bergdahl had an Army pass allowing him to be in Mendocino County, and military authorities were notified.\n\nIn a separate incident, an Anderson Valley couple, Thomas R. Plowright III and Patricia Plowright, were fined $25,000 for water violations related to illegal construction activities that allegedly caused sediment discharges into Little Mill Creek and its tributaries in Mendocino County. The Cleanup and Abatement Order, issued in January 2011, alleged that the Plowrights had reconstructed existing roads, built new ones, and used a bulldozer to move earthen material into watercourses, including Little Mill Creek outside of Philo. The creek feeds into the Navarro River and provides habitat for Steelhead trout and feeds streams that harbor Coho salmon.\n\nMichael Kisslinger, a former reporter for Mendocino County Public Radio and active in Ukiah-area civil affairs, passed away on July 20, 2015. Kisslinger leaves behind his wife, Anne Molgaard of First Five, an adult son, Zane, and a daughter, Aleyna. He was 60 years old.\n\nIn other news, a public workshop on \"Communication and Conflict Management Skills for Community Based Organizations\" at County Libraries in August has been canceled due to unfortunate circumstances. The proposed Coast trash transfer station did not receive the anticipated rubber stamp from a joint meeting of the Supervisors and Fort Bragg City Council. The meeting was postponed until August 18th in Ukiah. Fish and Wildlife is threatening a lawsuit if the $5 million project proceeds.

The US soldier, charged with desertion after he went missing in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years, was one of the people present Tuesday when sheriff's deputies rushed the Redwood Valley site and rounded up 181 marijuana plants, the New York Daily News reports. Bergdahl had been staying with \"old friends\" on the property since Friday while on approved leave from the Army, the Anderson Valley Advertiser reports. He \"apparently had no connection to the dope grow,\" the paper adds, and wasn't charged. By all accounts, Bergdahl was courteous and cooperative during the raid, with the Mendocino County sheriff telling the Advertiser that the soldier was \"above politeness.\" \"I'm not sticking up for the guy at all, but I will say this, he was very polite,\" the sheriff says, per the Daily News. \"He was not resistant at all. He shook everybody's hand. He thanked us all.\" And even though he wasn't implicated in any crime, Bergdahl's high profile prompted authorities to make calls \"all the way up to the Pentagon,\" which sent an Army major to bring Bergdahl back to his Texas base; he had been scheduled to return Wednesday. Bergdahl is currently awaiting a hearing to see if he'll face a court-martial. (Bergdahl has described his brutal treatment in captivity.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8684}
