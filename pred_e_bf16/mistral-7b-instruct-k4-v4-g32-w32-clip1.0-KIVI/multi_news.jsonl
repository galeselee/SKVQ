He was also a significant philanthropist, particularly in African-American education and culture.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on African-American communities in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of more than 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him. These schools played a crucial role in the education of thousands of African-American children, including civil rights activist John Lewis and poet Maya Angelou.\n\nA new documentary, \"Rosenwald,\" tells the story of his little-known contributions to African-American culture and education.

Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The evidence presented includes the use of copper alloy fasteners, which were not common in ships of the 15th or 16th century, and the absence of iron and/or wood fixations that should have been present on the Santa Maria.\n\nThe initial discovery was made by US marine archaeologist Barry Clifford in May, who claimed that the geographical, underwater topography, and archaeological evidence strongly suggested that the wreck was Columbus' famous flagship, the Santa Maria. Clifford also pointed out a metallic tube at the site, which he believed to be a cannon.\n\nHowever, a team of experts led by the former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, Xavier Nieto Prieto, concluded that the fasteners found at the site indicated a technique of ship construction that dates the ship to the late 17th or 18th Century rather than the 15th or 16th Century.

The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's body, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, a phenomenon known as superheating. This superheated ice can persist inside the fish for extended periods, even during summer warming episodes when temperatures rise above the expected melting point.\n\nThe researchers found that the ice crystals in the fish's body do not melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remain intact. This superheating is primarily due to the antifreeze protein, which binds to the ice crystals and alters their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or melt.\n\nThe long-term implications of this superheated ice are not yet clear, as it is unknown if there are any adverse effects on the fish's body. However, the researchers suggest that the spleen may be trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThe discovery of superheating in notothenioid fishes provides a better understanding of the progression of all species and highlights the idea that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences may also arise.
