Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.

A flotilla of recreational boats and jet skis rushed to the scene, pulling people from the boat as it went down and avoiding an even deadlier tragedy, the AP reports. Dramatic videos circulating on social media show the party boat rocking back and forth as people crawled down from a fourth-floor roof as it began sinking into the water. \"Those on the first and second floors sank immediately,\" a female survivor told Teleantioquia. \"The boat was sinking and all we could do was scream and call for help.\" Survivors described hearing a loud explosion near the men's bathroom that knocked out power a few minutes after the boat began its cruise around the lake. It's unclear what caused the boat to sink, but survivors said that it appeared to be overloaded and nobody on board was wearing a life vest.

It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham.

Mats Brannstrom, who leads the team, wouldn't say if any of the women are pregnant, and a study by the group said four women experienced \"mild rejection episodes\"; in fact, two had their uterus removed due to complications. \"One or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry, and one or two won't be able to get pregnant,\" said Brannstrom, the AP reports. Other doctors say the women must be carefully watched to see how well a transplanted uterus functions. \"It is a good sign they have done the transfers,\" said a doctor. \"But a live birth will be the best validation that this works.\" Controversy has surrounded the Swedish project because it accepted wombs from live women who are friends or family of the patients, creating possible health risks for the donors.

And so it's just passe at this juncture,\" Playboy CEO Scott Flanders tells the paper. The change apparently has the approval of 89-year-old founder and editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner, the BBC reports. The magazine will still feature racy photos of women, but analysts say the removal of nudes will be a big boost for its articles, including serious journalism and interviews, CNN reports. Flanders tells the Times that the target audience will be young, urban men. \"The difference between us and Vice is that we're going after the guy with a job,\" he quips. The Playboy company now makes most of its money from licensing its brand, and Flanders tells the Times that the magazine loses around $3 million a year in the US, which is a cost the firm sees as an expense for their \"Fifth Avenue storefront.\" The Times notes that the Playboy website became SFW and got rid of nudes last year, which execs say caused traffic to quadruple to 16 million users a month.

Labrie's lawyer, Jaye Rancourt, says he has been frightened and sad during his time in prison, most of which was spent on administrative segregation, and he plans to abide by bail conditions, including living at his mother's home in Vermont under a 5pm to 8am curfew.

Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender—who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots—also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him.

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The move, which was months in the making, came as a surprise to experts expecting a much more limited scope, the Wall Street Journal reports. Calling it a \"game changer,\" Mother Jones notes that it could heavily influence next year's climate talks in Paris.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

Democratic leaders point out that Sessions had recused himself from the investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign—an investigation Comey was leading, the New York Daily News reports. Rosenstein says Comey was fired for his handling of the Clinton email situation, saying he \"cannot defend\" Comey's behavior, the Times reports.

Chuck Schumer wonders if the Russia investigation was \"getting too close to home\" for Trump and calls for a special prosecutor to continue the investigation. CNN has a copy of Trump's termination letter to Comey, in which Trump says he \"greatly appreciate[s]\" Comey assuring him, \"on three separate occasions,\" that he is not under investigation, but nonetheless he does not believe Comey can effectively lead the FBI.

The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist.

Sanco and Grant, of Forth Worth, Texas, went to high school together and fell in love after reconnecting on Facebook last year. Sanco, who had a pilot's license, flew the couple to the Bahamas for a vacation and to get married, arriving in Freeport on Sept. 26. Sanco's last Instagram post shows a Bahamas sunrise. It's the final message family and friends received from the couple. After spending the night in Freeport, Sanco and Grant were supposed to fly on to Rum Cay, where they had rented a house, the Bahamas Tribune reports. Simmons says they made a planned stop on the island of North Eleuthera, where they purchased fuel, and departed for the 121-mile flight to Rum Cay. The owner of their rental house in Rum Cay says they never arrived. Weather reports had called for storms, and Sanco's plane had received unspecified repairs during the trip. Family hadn't expected to hear much from the couple during their vacation and didn't report them missing until they failed to return home. \"We're trying to remain hopeful, but we're also realistic,\" Sanco's niece, Lee-Ann Burger, tells People. \"I think at this point we're searching for answers.\" She says the family has hired private search crews to look for the couple."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1736}

The lake, located in the Gale Crater, would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide. The lake's mudstones—which form in calm, still water—contain traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, meaning it could have supported chemolithoautotrophs, a kind of microbial that obtains energy by breaking down rock minerals. The lake was revealed today amidst a barrage of papers on the Rover's progress. National Geographic breaks down some of the other key take-aways, including one that's less promising for Martian life hunters: Curiosity's first radiation measurements indicate levels that would be fatal, within a few million years, to anything within several meters of the surface.

Ford—who, unlike his brother, isn't known for drinking heavily or smoking crack—campaigned on a populist platform that led to comparisons to President Trump. Ford's campaign promises included cutting gasoline taxes, lowering the minimum price of beer to $1, and making marijuana more widely available after it is legalized this year, reports the Toronto Star. \"He had a simple product, and he was selling it at a lower price than anybody else in terms of tax cuts and other commitments of reduced prices, whether it was for gas and beer etc.,\" political science professor Myer Siemiatycki tells the CBC.

He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone. \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he recalls. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized. \"I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,\" he said, per Gothamist. (Variety notes that Hand to God, which has been struggling to sell tickets, was happy to capitalize by organizing that press conference.) The second incident occurred when Patti LuPone took the phone from an audience member who was texting during Show for Days. Given that she remained in character the whole time, the New York Post grants her a \"standing ovation.\" Vanity Fair rounds up previous incidents, saying they \"offer proof that, even if our movie theaters are slowly succumbing to the inevitability of omnipresent cell phones, the theater community may well choose to die on this hill.\" Plus, Broadway actors have a big advantage over movie actors: \"the ability to fight back.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2745}

The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Island snake is a unique species, reports the BBC. The snake is related to snakes found on part of the Mexican coast more than 500 miles away, and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago. Beebe returned from a visit to the island, located 400-plus miles off Mexico's Pacific coast, nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar, but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The National Museum of Natural History praised the team's work, describing the snake as the \"only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" The rediscovery \"is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,\" the museum said in a statement."], "all_classes": null, "length": 999}

The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours.

Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey.

Turnout is everything: If it’s high, that’s probably a good sign for Romney. If it’s low, it’s a good sign for Paul and/or Santorum—depending on where it’s concentrated.

Last-minute campaigning: Romney held rallies in four cities yesterday, his most since 2008. Paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in Des Moines, hoping to grab media buzz.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed.

The researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year, reports the BBC. Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate,\" says study co-author Isabella Velicogna of the University of California Irvine, per the AP. \"Things are happening. They are happening faster than we expected.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4628}

The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune.

The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history.

Now what? James Fallows at the Atlantic writes that if Corker truly believes Trump might blunder his way into World War III, he has an obligation to \"do something about it\" by providing a crucial check on Trump's actions through his position as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. \"Talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts.\" WSJ weighs in: The conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal thinks Corker spoke the truth about the president's \"lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O'Donnell,\" and it hopes other top Republicans follow Corker's lead because it might actually help. Little reaction: NBC News rounds up reaction from top Republicans to Corker's statements about the president and finds \"silence or a shrug.\" A typical sentiment, from Marco Rubio: \"You'll have to ask Sen.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4329}

Trump \"plans to distance himself from GOP losses.\" Insiders tell Politico that while Trump is currently describing the midterm vote as a vote on his presidency, he plans to break with recent precedent and distance himself from the results if there are serious GOP losses.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \"I have seen many, many such claims in my career,\" a planetary scientist at Colorado's Southwest Research Institute tells Nature. \"And all of them have been wrong.\" (The Washington Post caught up with Brown for a Q&A on the latest Pluto-killing endeavor.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4933}

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

Investigators say that so far, only the empty protective casing of the black box has been found. In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense.

It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom. This sea-change has been coming for years now, as an old Forbes piece shows, but some—including Steven Spielberg—believe Hollywood will over-invest in blockbusters: \"There’s going to be an implosion\" where several \"mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm again,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5611}

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years.

Trump departs Friday for an ambitious first foreign trip as president that will include Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican, a NATO meeting in Belgium, and the G7 summit in Sicily. A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion. The president's European stops will include meetings with Pope Francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, Time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump for a working lunch May 25. Sources tell the New York Times that Trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and Trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \"Remember, Trump is a nothing if not a showman,\" Hadley says. “He’s been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media.\" Heritage Foundation foreign policy expert James Carofano tells the Washington Post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for Trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in DC. \"The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access,\" he says. \"If you fumble on one of these trips, it’s nobody’s fault but your own.\" Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, disagrees. He tells the AP no other president has made a first foreign trip amid so much controversy. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes,\" he says. Melania Trump will be accompanying her husband on the trip, and her itinerary includes G7 and NATO spousal programs as well as speaking to American military families in Italy, Politico reports. \"This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries,\" she said in a statement Thursday.

The president of the Charleston NAACP tells the Post and Courier that a survivor says the gunman briefly sat down in the Emanuel AME Church before opening fire on a prayer meeting, but at a news conference this morning, Mullen said the shooter stuck around for almost an hour before the shooting began, the AP reports. Mullen also distributed a surveillance video of a possible suspect and vehicle, and added that the victims were six females and three males. The NAACP chief says the gunman told one woman he was letting her live so she could tell others what happened. \"It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives,\" Mullen told reporters. \"I can assure you that we're going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up and to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.\" Mayor Joe Riley called the suspect \"one hateful person,\" describing the shooting as \"the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine.\" In other developments: Helicopters are circling Charleston in the search for the suspect, who's described as a white male, around 21 years old, slender, clean-shaven, and wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans, and Timberland boots, the Guardian reports. Police say he is \"obviously extremely dangerous.\" State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor, was in the church at the time of the attack, and State House Minority leader Todd Rutherford tells the AP that the lawmaker was among those killed.

He touched everybody.\" The Post and Courier has more on the history of the church, which it calls the \"spiritual home to one of the oldest and largest black congregations south of Baltimore,\" and which many in the city call \"Mother Emanuel.\" Its roots go back to 1816, and it was burned after one of its founders tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

The zoo, however, says that while it is devastated by the death of the male western lowland gorilla, the boy was in imminent danger and tranquilizers would not have worked quickly enough. A witness says that after the boy fell 15 feet into in the enclosure, the gorilla seemed protective at first, but he became agitated as visitors screaming and started dragging the boy through a moat. A witness tells CNN that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted, the boy had to \"climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" He was released from a hospital on Saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is \"doing just fine,\" the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. \"We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla,\" they said. The BBC notes that a similar incident in Britain in 1986 had a happier ending.

Police say that inside the residence, they found several malnourished and dirty children \"shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings\"—and parents David and Louise Turpin were \"unable to provide a logical reason\" why they were restrained. Investigators initially thought the couple's 13 children were all juveniles, but they were shocked to discover that seven were adults and the oldest was 29.

Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return. Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on Russian hacking, the Washington Post reports. \"Part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel. He warns that if it is proved false, it will \"forever discredit ... future journalistic exposés that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 5652}

Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas had a stronger phrase: \"mob rule,\" while Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois heard the \"noise of democracy.\" Democrats were staging a unified front to try to keep the hearing from proceeding, angry about withheld documents from Kavanaugh's past, including his tenure in the George W. Bush White House. The release of more than 40,000 documents Monday night seems to have only made things worse, with Democrats arguing that it was humanly impossible to review them in time. Despite the Democrats' protests, Senate Judiciary Committee Charles Grassley says he will not stop the hearing, which is expected to last four days, reports Politico.

The question, said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is not whether he believes that Roe v.

The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN!\" tweeted Giuliani, who worked with McCarthy in New York when Giuliani was mayor.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people.

Duncan—who will also face criminal charges if he pulls through—has no health insurance, and it's not clear if the bill will ever be paid. \"It's too early to make a decision about payment of bills; he is in critical condition,\" a Liberian Embassy spokesman says. \"The focus is on his health.\" More: Duncan, 42, is receiving an experimental drug, and health officials say there have been a few positive signs: He's still on dialysis, but his blood pressure and temperature are now normal, reports the New York Times. None of the 48 people under observation who came into contact with him are showing Ebola symptoms. But with the incubation deadline days away, Dallas is on edge, reports the AP. \"This is a very critical week,\" says Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey. \"We're at a very sensitive period when a contact could develop symptoms. We're monitoring with extreme vigilance.\" Before he became unresponsive, Duncan apologized to his fiancee and told her he would have \"preferred to stay in Liberia and died than bring this to you,\" a family friend tells the Washington Post. The friend says he told her, \"I'm so sorry all of this is happening ... I would not put the love of my life in danger.\" Duncan's relatives have been able to view him via a video system, but they decided not to during a hospital visit yesterday because earlier images had been too disturbing. \"What we saw was very painful.

The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

The reviewed cases include 32 defendants given the death sentence, 14 of whom have already died in prison or were executed; about 2,500 cases involving hair matches are being looked at in all. Of course, other evidence may have sufficed to convict defendants found guilty.

Now 46 states and the District of Columbia are receiving information that could lead to appeals, if defense lawyers, prosecutors, or judges are willing or able.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

A statement from the Syrian military denounced the strike as \"blatant aggression\" that will be a setback to its \"counterterrorist\" activity. Deutsche Welle reports that the attack was endorsed by European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Bashar al-Assad bears \"sole responsibility\" for the strike against his regime's forces. Russia's military says only 23 out of the 59 American missiles reached the Shayrat airbase in Homs province, the AP reports. The military says the attack destroyed six Syrian planes, but left the runway intact. Vladimir Putin has denounced the strike as American aggression, a spokesman says. The New York Times looks at the risks and opportunities the strike has opened up for Trump. There's now an opportunity for the US to demand that Russia help get rid of Assad—but there's the risk Putin might reject any such deal, that the strike could hurt the fight against ISIS, and that Trump's team has no real plan for peace in Syria. Syrian opposition groups welcomed the attack and said they hoped it marked the beginning of a wider campaign against Assad. \"For Syrians, any military intervention that will neutralize Assad’s ability to continue his genocide will fall on our hearts like music,\" a civil defense volunteer in northern Syria tells the Los Angeles Times.

Today, President Obama and two key advisers will push for a diplomatic means of avoiding a nuclear Iran; tomorrow, in a controversial speech to Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will push back against the plan, the New York Times reports. To set the scene: Netanyahu left Tel Aviv yesterday for what he called \"a fateful, even historic, mission\" for which he is \"an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,\" Reuters reports. His speech will likely call for boosted sanctions against Iran, but Obama has suggested he would veto any bill giving Congress a chance to legislate on the matter. This weekend, Netanyahu offered conciliatory words, saying he \"respected\" Obama and that \"strength will prevail over differences of opinion.\" Obama will meet Reuters for an interview this afternoon, while National Security Adviser Susan Rice and UN Ambassador Samantha Power speak to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a group Netanyahu will also address, the Times reports. The paper sees the meetings as a chance for the administration to reaffirm its support for Israel. Indeed, John Kerry yesterday noted on ABC's This Week that Netanyahu \"is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history,\" Reuters reports. Kerry tomorrow will join international officials in Switzerland as they look to outline an Iranian deal by the month's end, the Washington Post reports. Kerry has been working closely—too closely, according to some Iranian lawmakers—with Iran's foreign minister to hammer out a deal, the Times reports. \"He has made a huge investment of his time and energy in the talks, and his personal, hands-on involvement in recent months has been crucial to building momentum toward a deal,\" says an analyst. But some worry that Iran could read Kerry's \"eagerness\" as an opening to seek more concessions. Meanwhile, the UN's nuclear agency says Iran is coming up short on providing essential information, Reuters reports. \"The (IAEA) is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,\" the agency's chief says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6018}

Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia.

They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65% more likely to attempt suicide themselves (what NDTV refers to as the phenomenon of \"suicide contagion\") than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes—or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release.

And the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person's outlook. \"Suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject,\" Pitman notes. \"Avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized, and sometimes even blamed for the death.\" That's not to say, though, that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate. \"These outcomes are by no means inevitable,\" Pitman says. \"If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available.\" (A Marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 5691}

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports. Some of Walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including Marco Rubio, who called him \"one of the best governors in the country,\" and Donald Trump, who said \"he's a very nice person and has a great future,\" reports the Hill.

It’s how the first two Bushes took out Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry—and how Jeb plans to take out Hillary,\" Bill Curry writes. And Clinton isn't helping herself. \"When she says she and Bill were broke when they left the White House; when she sets her own email rules and says it was only for her own convenience; when she hangs out with the Davos, Wall Street, or Hollywood crowds, she makes herself a more inviting target.\" Meanwhile, statistician Nate Silver acknowledges that Clinton is \"very likely to become the Democratic nominee.\" As for the general election, he writes at FiveThirtyEight, it could go either way. Silver questions the so-called \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" that plays a role in Chait's thinking. Right now, Clinton's favorability ratings are \"break-even,\" and she's \"so well-known … that it’s almost as if voters are dispensing with all the formalities and evaluating her as they might when she’s on the ballot next November. About half of them would like to see her become president and about half of them wouldn’t.

On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4159}

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10540}

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training. But parents should know the dangers: \"Until proven otherwise,\" a lawyer tells Flanagan, \"they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in.\" Click for her full piece."], "all_classes": null, "length": 13444}

In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes.

In mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains—the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience.

Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright—founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo—blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $60 million in Bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million Bitcoins worth $605 million—the same amount attributed to Nakamoto. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" Wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day Newsweek claimed American Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's inventor.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

When Yanukovych fled the country, Kernes briefly did too, before returning and declaring that he now supported a united Ukraine.

Cory Booker says he has ordered his staff to release a Kavanaugh email even though it's supposed to remain under wraps.

Booker called his act one of civil disobedience, reports NPR. \"I openly invite and accept the consequences,\" he said, per CNN. \"The penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.\" Indeed, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges \"the secret or confidential business\" of the Senate faces expulsion, reports the Washington Post. \"Bring the charges,\" said Booker. \"All of us are ready to face that rule,\" added fellow Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is \"settled law.\" He was going over a draft opinion stating that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time.

A previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former District Attorney Mary Lacy erred when she exonerated members of the Ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier DNA tests. Lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl, but outside forensic experts have since disputed that, asserting that the DNA was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as \"Unknown Male 1.\" \"If you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem,\" explained a former US attorney for Colorado. The new, more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right. They could also reveal the DNA is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer, and merely the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" per the Camera. One of the most high-profile anniversary stories about the case came via CBS, whose expert panel concluded that JonBenet's brother, Burke, killed his sister. Burke has since sued, but the forensic pathologist he's going after argued in court documents this month that his view on the case was mere \"speculation\" about \"one of the major unsolved crimes\" of the 20th century and thus should be protected speech, reports People.

Premixed drinks or any other \"common source of alcohol\" (including kegs) is prohibited; beer can be doled out in unopened cans, but wine can be poured and served only by a sober monitor. And that's if guests make it into the party: Under a section titled \"Eliminating Discomfort and Chaos: Entry Management\" is a mandate for a hired security guard at the entry door to check guest lists during \"Tier I\" events (larger parties); a frat member can monitor the list during smaller \"Tier II\" events.

Snowden—who admits he doesn't expect to see home again—says he chose Hong Kong because they \"have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent,\" though his first choice for asylum would be Iceland, CNN reports. Some Hong Kong politicians say the territory's history of working closely with the US makes it a poor choice for Snowden—though others say they are \"flattered.\" A criminal investigation into the leak has begun and the US is expected to begin extradition proceedings soon; a long legal battle in Hong Kong could ensue before Beijing decides on using its veto, the Wall Street Journal reports. In the meantime, Snowden has gotten his very own White House petition, with some 8,734 people, at the time of this writing, requesting \"a full, free, and absolute pardon\" for the \"national hero.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 8571}

Among the accusations: Corrupt gamblers have contacted players in their hotels and offered them $50,000 or more to fix a match. Gambling syndicates in Russia and Italy then placed \"highly suspicious bets on scores of matches—including at Wimbledon and the French Open,\" says Buzzfeed. More than 70 players are suspected of taking part, but Buzzfeed and the BBC decided not to print names because the suspects' computer, bank, and phone records weren't available as conclusive proof. Suspects include winners of Grand Slam singles and doubles titles, and eight players slated to play in the Australian Open starting Monday. \"There is an element of actually keeping things under wraps,\" says an investigator.

The town is home to Fethullah Gulen, an influential cleric who leads a popular movement called Hizmet, and President Recep Tayyib Erdogan blames his followers for the coup attempt that left at least 161 dead in overnight clashes, the New York Times reports. \"I have a message for Pennsylvania: You have engaged in enough treason against this nation,\" Erdogan said early Saturday. \"If you dare, come back to your country.\" Gulen, a moderate Muslim cleric who has lived in the US since 1999, was Erdogan's ally until 2013, when the leader blamed him for corruption allegations. In other coverage: Vox has more on the Gulenist movement, which runs a large network of schools and supports interfaith dialogue, secular democracy, science, and a progressive stance on social issues. Gulen says he condemns the coup attempt \"in the strongest terms.\" The AP reports that John Kerry says the US would consider an extradition request for Gulen, though nothing has been received yet and firm evidence would be required. \"We fully anticipate that there will be questions raised about Mr. Gulen,\" Kerry told reporters. \"And obviously we would invite the government of Turkey, as we always do, to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny.\" The New York Times looks at how the fallout from the coup will make the region's politics even more complicated for the US and Europe, which saw Erdogan's government as a stable and reliable ally. \"The danger here is this could spiral out of control and turn into a full-blown civil war,\" says former US Ambassador to Turkey Eric S. Edelman. CNN reports on how many civilian supporters of Erdogan stood up to the coup attempt, in some cases blocking military vehicles with their cars and even lying down in front of tanks. Almost 3,000 military service members have been arrested and almost the same number of judges have been removed from their duties in what appears to be a nationwide purge of Gulen supporters, the Guardian reports. Reuters reports that Erdogan, who had been vacationing on the country's southeast coast, addressed thousands of supporters after flying into Ankara's airport early Saturday. \" This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army,\" he said. Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim says 161 people were killed and 1,440 were injured in the coup attempt, but a government source tells the AP that the figures exclude coup plotters, meaning the true toll could be much higher.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors. A senior Obama official acknowledges that anger but says such compromises are necessary and pale in comparison to the greater good of a nuclear deal. Here's one sample of early reaction, from the conservative Hot Air site: \"Barack Obama and John Kerry desperately needed a win on foreign policy in 2015-6 after seeing its 'smart power' approach turn the Middle East and Caucasus into flames,\" writes Ed Morrissey. \"They didn’t care if it was a short-term win that sacrificed long-term national security.\" Read the full Politico piece here."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9746}

Welsh spent much of Thursday morning on Twitter retweeting posts that trashed Dylan's win, and tweeting: \"I'm a Dylan fan, but this is an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.\" His main beef appears to be the separation of a metaphorical church and state—in this case, songs and lit—that he thinks should exist, adding, \"If you're a 'music' fan, look it up in the dictionary. Then 'literature'. Then compare and contrast.\" Other takes on Dylan's new laureate status: The Wall Street Journal lists feedback from major authors, from the gushing—Salman Rushdie writes on Twitter, \"From Orpheus to Faiz, song & poetry have been closely linked. Dylan is the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition. Great choice\"—to the eyerolling, including satirical writer Gary Shteyngart's take: \"I totally get the Nobel committee. Reading books is hard.\" Jay Perini gives a thumbs-up at CNN, noting how Dylan's songs \"speak to our deepest concerns\" and how he's \"filled our heads with language that both interprets and transforms the realities we confront.\" At the Guardian, Richard Williams looks at whether music and literature can actually be successfully linked (in terms of a Nobel Prize), and he breaks it down line by line to show the \"profound resonance\" of Dylan's lyrics. Robert Chalmers makes the slightly uncomfortable observation for GQ that \"everything would be so much more simple if he were dead,\" as Dylan would have ascended to legendary status. But Chalmers still jumps on the pro-Dylan bandwagon, noting, \"His voice may, like the Havana cigars and bourbon to which it is often lazily compared, be an acquired taste, but Dylan is responsible, as much as Billie Holiday, for reinventing the whole style of popular singing.\" Meanwhile, a naysayer singing the Black \"Eating Crow\" Blues: Alex Shephard, who wrote last week for the New Republic that \"Bob Dylan 100 percent is not going to win.

His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 9424}

The proposal—titled \"America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again\"—contains cuts that the Washington Post says could be the biggest reduction in federal programs since the post-World War II drawdown. The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%. Military spending would be beefed up by $54 billion under the proposal, $1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and Homeland Security would get a 6.8% funding increase. A roundup of coverage about the $1.15 trillion spending plan: The document is here. Politico reports that the budget is \"red meat\" for Trump's base, with deep cuts to their most disliked government agencies and programs, though it is also what's known as a \"skinny budget\" because it is so short on details. A more detailed budget will be out in May. The AP lists winners and losers. The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday. He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,\" Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters. \"We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets.\" The Hill notes that such proposals tend to be \"little more than guidance\" for lawmakers—and that the Senate shot down Obama's 2015 budget 98 to 1. The AP reports that the budget funds Trump's boost for the Pentagon, the biggest since Ronald Reagan's, with cuts to conservative targets including the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, and the AmeriCorps national service program. NBC notes that Trump's proposal, which makes cuts to 12 out of 15 Cabinet agencies, only covers the \"discretionary\" quarter of the $4 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in October. The portion dealing with issues including taxation, Social Security, and Medicare is due in mid-May.

Some specifics: Facing a direct hit, New Jersey is suffering flooding, high winds, and 434,000 power outages. Part of the Garden State Highway has been closed due to rising waters, and Atlantic City is so flooded that cars are underwater, CNN reports. Part of the city's famed boardwalk has been washed away.

Andrew Cuomo has requested 1,000 National Guard troops be deployed. About 452,000 are without power, and emergency crews have responded to a construction crane hanging dangerously from a luxury high-rise. The story is similar in Pennsylvania, specifically Philadelphia, which has also shut down its mass transit system, and seen hundreds of flights canceled. Officials say wind could reach 75mph and rainfall 10 inches. National Guardsmen have been told to be ready for deployment. Power outages: 74,000. Flooding is expected to knock out power stations in Connecticut, killing power for 117,400. Several coastal communities in Massachusetts are being urged to voluntarily evacuate, the Boston Globe reports, and in Boston all subway and bus service was shut down at 2pm. Nearly 1,000 crews are out helping more than 300,000 who have lost power. Flooding is expected along the coast with this evening's high tide. Washington, DC closed its rail service for the first time since 2003, and the federal government has closed up shop save for emergency employees, the Washington Post reports. Nearly 5,500 are without power. In Virginia about 9,500 people are without power, and the same could happen to about 1 million more.

The woman who's adorned hundreds of billboards across LA since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym Angelyne—she's been called a precursor to other \"famous for being famous\" celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian—appears to have started off as Ronia Tamar Goldberg.

Baum reached out to Goldberg's alleged younger sister, now Annette Block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all.

Pistorius in particular comes off as an egomaniac with long-standing anger issues. \"When Pistorius competed at the London Olympics, last summer, (a radio host) interviewed the athlete’s roommate at the Olympic Village: ‘What is it like to sleep in the same room with a superstar?’ And he said, ‘I moved out.

He wasn’t like that; he was made into that.\" In subsequent training sessions at a gym, his “swearing would astonish the mothers and children also using the gym,\" says a reporter. “He would storm out of the gym midway through a workout.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

He gave his life for my country. I promised I would do this.\" Morgan's story is the stuff of movies (and has in fact been optioned by George Clooney): He became the only foreigner other than Che to reach the Cuban army's highest rank, comandante; fell in love with and married Olga Rodriguez; and reportedly told the firing squad that executed him, \"I kneel for no man.\" But \"once he died, much larger events eclipsed his story,\" says Michael Sallah, the author of The Yankee Comandante. \"He kind of got lost in history.\" Havana scrubbed mention of him, and his American citizenship was only restored in 2007, notes the Beast.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN. Other researchers remain unconvinced, but Hakai says now Lance's theory is \"their theory to disprove.\" More on her project here.

By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did.

{"pred": "The passage of all Americans.", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

Seriously. The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on. Today's astronauts enjoy actual restrooms, though MAG systems are provided to astronauts who are operating outside space vehicles.

Dylan discussed three favorite works from childhood and Andrea Pitzer at Slate suspects the Nobel Prize winner for literature may have cribbed much of the Moby Dick portion from SparkNotes. She says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble SparkNotes passages and compares several of them side by side. Multiple phrases, including \"Ahab's lust for vengeance,\" appear both in SparkNotes and Dylan's talk, but not in Moby Dick itself. He had to give the talk to collect $922,000 in prize money. \"Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness,\" a quote that one blogger thought Dylan had invented, appears to be based on SparkNotes. Pitzer suggests that Dylan donate some of the prize money to the SparkNotes writer, though others are more forgiving. University of Minnesota music professor Alex Lubet tells the Star-Tribune that Dylan's lecture shouldn't be treated like a classroom assignment. \"His lecture is wild and strange,\" Lubet says. \"It’s meant to be a post-modern work of art.

A former senior intelligence official tells the Washington Post that the leak, which experts believe is genuine, could \"cause grave if not irreparable damage to the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct our mission.\" A roundup of coverage: One hack, code-named Weeping Angel, allows spies to capture audio and possibly video from Samsung smart TVs that appear to be turned off.

MIT Technology Review describes the leaked information, including news that the CIA has found vulnerabilities in iOS and Android, as \"sinister\" but not \"particularly Earth-shattering\" from a technological point of view. Business Insider examines some of WikiLeaks' claims and finds that there's no evidence that the CIA was able to crack the encryption of apps like Signal and WhatsApp. Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, tells the New York Times he's disturbed by signs that the government knew about vulnerabilities in electronic devices and kept them quiet to make spying easier. \"Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world,\" Wizner says. \"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\" Forbes spoke to security experts from several companies about the leak. They said the information about the CIA's technological capabilities is unsurprising, but that it should serve as a reminder to people that they cannot fully trust the security of their devices. \"People need to wake up to the fact that they need to take responsibility for maintaining the privacy of their information and make no assumptions,\" says Ajay Arora, CEO of Vera. \"At the end of the day, no one has your best interests in mind but you—people can't even trust their own government anymore. This is the tragic new normal we have to all unfortunately accept.\" Companies including Google, Samsung, and WhatsApp declined to comment, the Washington Post reports.

The fundraiser is being spearheaded by Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is headquartered in Chico, Calif., an area that was threatened by the Camp Fire, which burned more than 153,000 acres, destroyed some 19,000 buildings, and killed at least 85 people in Butte County earlier this month. Sierra Nevada brewed its batch of Resilience IPA on Tuesday, founder Ken Grossman said in a statement, and the brewer will make it available in late December. “We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we’re in this for the long haul,” Grossman says. “Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community’s future.” (Check out participating breweries here.) While the Camp Fire, which was fully contained as of Sunday, left the Sierra Nevada brewery unscathed, it did destroy the homes of 15% of the company’s employees, KRCR reports. Initially, the brewer was hoping to get 500 other breweries on board to make Resilience IPA, spokesman Robin Gregory says, adding that they have been “absolutely blown away” by the response. Overall, the company expects the effort to produce about 8.6 million pints. Resilience is described as a “classic” West Coast-style IPA (here’s the recipe for homebrewers).

MDHHS officials first observed the rise in Legionnaires' cases in the fall of 2014, per the Free Press, and researchers found the bacteria to blame was proliferating in larger buildings, many with older plumbing. \"Our hypothesis is that something about the Flint River and lack of corrosion control, plus big buildings, is creating these problems,\" Marc Edwards, head of an independent Virginia team looking into the crisis, tells the Free Press.

He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \"rushed to the exits\" at the thought of Obama's move.

Producer David Broome denies there's anything in the film that says Penn \"is in cahoots\" with the Justice Department and that both he and Netflix tried to see if Penn wanted to take part (Penn reportedly never answered); Netflix backs that up, saying in a statement \"Penn was given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate.\" Broome says when Penn saw an advance copy of the film, he demanded changes. Deadline notes that Penn's lawyers contacted Netflix shortly after and said Penn was afraid Guzman's associates might go after him if the film wasn't altered. A letter from Penn's lawyer to Netflix notes that \"blood will be on [Netflix's] hands if this film causes bodily harm\" to Penn. (In the end, Penn thought his Rolling Stone article on El Chapo was a failure.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 12436}

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ... These legal developments could signal that a similar change in thinking is underway regarding distracted driving.\" (Jenny McCarthy's son called the cops for her texting-while-driving transgression.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 10869}

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}

As of 5pm, it had been downgraded to a Category 2, though winds were still a powerful 110mph. That is technically below \"major hurricane\" status, notes the AP, though the distinction may be small comfort to cities along its path. Perhaps the biggest concern continues to be the densely populated Tampa-St. Petersburg area, thought to be \"woefully ill-equipped\" to handle such a big storm, per the Washington Post. Irma should arrive there after midnight. “Today is going to the be the long day,” says Mark DeMaria of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Though Miami avoided a direct hit, the driving rain and storm surges have flooded parts of the downtown area, particularly the Brickell neighborhood. And two construction cranes have collapsed onto buildings in Miami, though no casualties were reported. In Palm Bay, also on the east coast, a related tornado destroyed six mobile homes, reports USA Today.
