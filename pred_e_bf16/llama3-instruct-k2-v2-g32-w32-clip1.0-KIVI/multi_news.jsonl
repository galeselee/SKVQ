While the initial mission to demystify the workplace for girls has been accomplished, it is now time to take them to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, to encourage them to become leaders. The current rate of women in top leadership positions is stagnant, with women making up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo bridge this gap, companies need to shift their focus from simply showing girls what an office looks like to providing them with role models, explaining what leaders do, and supporting programs that identify and groom female talent. Introducing girls to female role models, such as CEOs and executive officers, can make a significant difference. Companies can also provide sponsorship, which involves using one's political capital to support protégés, rather than just offering advice.\n\nThe Girl Scouts' recent study found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action at the workplace. By highlighting the accomplishments of female leaders and providing opportunities for girls to interact with them, companies can help close this gap.\n\nPrinceton University's efforts to increase female representation in leadership roles are a model for other institutions. The university's faculty started proactively encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\nIn conclusion, taking our daughters to the C-suite is a call to action for women's leadership.

These proteins, which prevent the fish's blood from freezing in the freezing waters of Antarctica, have been found to also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals in their veins for most of their lives, which could potentially be life-threatening.\n\nResearchers from the University of Oregon and the University of Illinois conducted a study to investigate the melting point of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. They found that the ice crystals resist melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point, and that the fish can even carry ice crystals in their bodies at temperatures above 1°C above the melting point.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. This means that the fish's bodies may be unable to rid themselves of the ice crystals, even in warmer temperatures.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the fish may have evolved a mechanism to clear the ice crystals from their circulation, but this is still unknown. The study also highlights the potential risks of carrying ice crystals in the fish's bodies, including the possibility of life-threatening blockages in small blood vessels.\n\nThe discovery provides new insights into the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the trade-offs that come with them.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and experts are urging the council to take action to protect the sardine population. The PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and sharks struggling to find food. The sardine fishing industry is also suffering, with fishermen reporting low catches and some environmental groups advocating for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe cause of the decline is unclear, but scientists point to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. This has repelled sardines, which are typically found in warmer waters. The decline has been so severe that the population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has also taken a dive.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with its numbers fluctuating wildly in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The species has a history of collapse and rebound, with the most recent collapse occurring in the 1950s. The current decline is the steepest since then, and experts warn that if sardines don't recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years.\n\nForage fish, including sardines, are a crucial component of the ocean food web, providing energy for predators and supporting commercial fisheries. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force estimates that forage fish worldwide are worth $11.3 billion when left in the water, compared to $5.6 billion when caught. The PFMC should prioritize the conservation of forage fish to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean ecosystem.\n\nFor more information, please visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish or contact the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

However, a closer look at his legacy reveals a complex and controversial figure. Sharon was a key player in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 50,000 civilians and the destruction of entire neighborhoods. He was also responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacres, in which Israeli-backed Christian militias killed nearly 1,400 Palestinian and Lebanese civilians.\n\nSharon's actions were often characterized by a disregard for human life and a willingness to use violence to achieve his goals. He was known for his brutal tactics, including the slaughter of innocent civilians, and his refusal to accept the legitimacy of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation.\n\nDespite his controversial past, Sharon's later years saw a shift towards a more moderate approach. He became a proponent of a two-state solution and withdrew Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. However, his vision for peace was met with skepticism and disappointment, and his legacy remains a subject of debate.\n\nIn a recent op-ed, Henry Kissinger, a former Secretary of State, wrote that Sharon's vision for peace was a \"sacrifice on behalf of raising prospects for a lasting peace.\" He noted that Sharon's willingness to cede territory and make concessions was a crucial step towards achieving peace, but that the result was ultimately disappointing.\n\nIn contrast, another op-ed, written by a critic of Sharon's, argued that his legacy was one of violence, deception, and destruction. The author pointed to Sharon's role in the Sabra and Shatila massacres and his use of the term \"terrorism\" to demean Palestinian resistance as evidence of his lack of commitment to peace.\n\nOverall, the legacy of Ariel Sharon is complex and multifaceted. While some see him as a peacemaker who made significant concessions towards achieving peace, others view him as a war criminal who was responsible for countless deaths and destruction.

For example, 65% of former vegetarians and vegans reported transitioning to their diet in just a few days or weeks, which may not be sustainable in the long term. Additionally, 58% of former vegetarians cited health as the main motivator for quitting their diet, while 58% of current vegetarians cited multiple reasons for being vegetarian, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health.\n\nThe study also found that relationships play a significant role in people's decisions to adopt or give up a vegetarian or vegan diet. For example, 33% of former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarian or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. The study suggests that advocates should focus on promoting a reduction in animal product consumption rather than complete elimination, as this may be more effective in creating a decline in animal product consumption.\n\nIn a personal account, a former vegetarian shares their experience of giving up a vegetarian diet and returning to eating meat.

The study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Pew Charitable Trusts, analyzed data from 2010-2011 and found that most of these unnecessary prescriptions are for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, and flu.\n\nThe study also found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the US result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions. However, half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many of these conditions are viral and do not require antibiotics.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has serious consequences, including the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can lead to life-threatening infections.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times.

{"pred": "A recent study by Pecan Street Research Institute has challenged the conventional wisdom that solar panels should face south to maximize energy production. The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that solar panels facing west produced 2% more electricity in a day and generated more electricity during peak demand hours, reducing grid dependence by 65% compared to 54% for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels are more effective at capturing energy during the late afternoon, when energy demand is typically highest. This is because the sun sets in the west during the summer months, coinciding with peak demand hours. The study's results also indicate that west-facing panels reduce the amount of electricity that homeowners need to draw from the grid during peak demand hours, making it easier for utility companies to manage energy supply and demand.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the residential solar market. It suggests that homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar panels, may actually be good candidates for west-facing solar panels. Additionally, the study's results could prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, which are currently not eligible for rebates.\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, it is important to note that the results may vary depending on the region and the structure of the incentives provided by utility companies. For example, in regions with different solar radiation patterns or utility companies that offer different incentives, the benefits of west-facing solar panels may be different.\n\nOverall, the study's findings highlight the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice, rather than relying solely on theoretical models.

However, subsequent searches failed to find any more individuals, and the species was largely forgotten, with only a single preserved specimen remaining.\n\nRecently, a team of researchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, led by Daniel Mulcahy, suspected that the species might still exist. They conducted an expedition to the Revillagigedo Islands, using Beebe's original field notes as a guide, and were rewarded with the rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake. The team found 11 snakes matching Beebe's description, and DNA tests confirmed that they were genetically distinct from other snakes in mainland Mexico.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant not only because it is a rare example of a species thought to be extinct, but also because it highlights the importance of preserving historical data and museum collections. The team plans to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the delicate ecosystem of the Clarion Island.\n\nThe discovery has also sparked interest in the fragility of island ecosystems, with the example of the Socorro dove, which went extinct in its natural habitat in the 1970s, but was later reintroduced through conservation efforts.

The virus was first identified in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia after laboratory workers handled African green monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then, there have been 11 reported outbreaks, with a case-fatality rate ranging from 23% to 90%.\n\n**Quarantine and Testing**\n\nAbout 99 people who came into contact with the victim have been quarantined, including 60 healthcare workers. Eleven people, including the victim's brother, have tested negative for Marburg, and those who still show symptoms will be re-tested in three days.\n\n**Transmission and Treatment**\n\nMarburg is spread through direct contact with blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, such as fruit bats. There is no specific treatment for Marburg, but hospitalized patients receive general supportive therapy, including fluid replacement and blood transfusions. Experimental treatments are being developed, similar to those for Ebola.\n\n**Outbreak History**\n\nPrevious outbreaks of Marburg have occurred in Uganda, Kenya, and Angola, with the largest outbreak in 1998 infecting 154 people and killing 128. The most recent outbreak in Uganda in 2012 infected 15 people and killed four.\n\n**Government Response**\n\nUganda's Ministry of Health has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures, and the country has experience in handling similar health threats, including Ebola. The World Health Organization has been informed, and the country's prime minister has assured that the situation is under control.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Marburg is a deadly virus, the current outbreak in Uganda is unlikely to escalate into a large-scale outbreak, given the country's experience in handling similar health threats. The government's response and the quarantine measures in place are expected to contain the spread of the virus.", "answers": ["At least 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations in Uganda so far after State House Uganda confirmed a man died this week of the Marburg virus—a type of hemorrhagic fever that's strikingly similar to Ebola, CNN reports.

A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

One possibility is that dark energy, a mysterious force that is thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be more powerful than previously thought. Another possibility is that Einstein's theory of relativity, which has been widely accepted for over a century, may be incomplete or even wrong.\n\nThe study's findings also raise questions about the nature of dark matter and dark radiation, which make up approximately 95% of the universe but do not emit light or radiation.

The defeat is \"the most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history,\" writes Grant Wahl for Sports Illustrated. \"Unthinkable,\" declares the New York Times. \"With that loss, the USMNT gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it’s not really close,\" writes Andrew Joseph for USA Today. \"It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years,\" writes Frank Isola at the Daily News. The kicker is that two other games fell the wrong way in unexpected fashion, one on a \"phantom goal,\" sealing the US fate. Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat Mexico, and Panama rallied from one goal back to beat Costa Rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here. The story raises the faint hope that the US could appeal the goal ruling, but it seems unlikely. \"As far as I know, there is no recourse,\" says a US soccer official. Pity Fox Sports: The network paid $200 million, outbidding ESPN, for the rights to televise the 2018 World Cup and showcase teen phenom Christian Pulisic, notes Business Insider. It's now going to be tough for that investment to pay off. Five culprits: Yahoo Sports looks at what went wrong in the US game, and why Bruce Arena has almost certainly coached his last game for the team."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4971}
{"pred": "The Zika virus has been a major concern globally, with cases reported in over 93 countries. The virus, which is primarily spread through mosquito bites, has been linked to severe birth defects and has caused widespread panic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global emergency, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that the virus is \"scarier than we thought.\"\n\nThe virus has been reported in the United States, with cases confirmed in Florida, Texas, and New Jersey. The CDC has advised pregnant women to postpone travel to areas where the virus has been reported, and has also warned that the virus can be spread through sexual contact.\n\nThe Obama administration has requested $1.8 billion in emergency funding to combat the virus, and has also transferred $34 million from the Ebola response fund to help combat the virus. The CDC has also begun testing for the virus in blood donations, and has advised that the majority of blood supplies are safe from the virus.\n\nThe virus has also been linked to microcephaly, a condition where the brain does not develop properly, and has caused widespread concern among parents and healthcare providers. The WHO has also warned that the virus could spread through blood transfusions, and has advised that blood banks take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe Rio Olympics, which are set to take place in August, have also been affected by the virus, with athletes and officials taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. The International Olympic Committee has also advised that athletes who have been infected with the virus should not participate in the games.\n\nIn addition to the health concerns, the virus has also had an economic impact, with the tourism industry in Brazil and other affected countries taking a hit. The virus has also caused widespread panic, with many people taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nOverall, the Zika virus has been a major global health concern, with widespread panic and concern among healthcare providers, athletes, and the general public. The virus has also had a significant economic impact, and has highlighted the need for increased funding and resources to combat the virus.", "answers": ["As thousands of people deal with treacherous flooding in southern Louisiana, a new danger may enter into the mix: increased risk of a mosquito surge over the next few weeks, and with them, the potential spread of the Zika virus, a tropical medicine expert tells USA Today. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.
