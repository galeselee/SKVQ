While the initial mission to demystify the workplace for girls has been accomplished, it is now time to take them to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, to encourage them to become leaders. The current rate of women in top leadership positions is stagnant, with women making up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo bridge this gap, companies need to shift their focus from simply showing girls what an office looks like to providing them with role models, explaining what leaders do, and supporting programs that identify and groom female talent. Introducing girls to female role models, such as CEOs and executive officers, can make a significant difference. Companies can also provide sponsorship, which involves using one's political capital to support protégés, rather than just offering advice.\n\nThe Girl Scouts' recent study found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action at the workplace. By highlighting the accomplishments of female leaders and providing opportunities for girls to interact with them, companies can help close this gap.\n\nPrinceton University's efforts to increase female representation in leadership roles are a model for other institutions. The university's faculty started proactively encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\nIn conclusion, taking our daughters to the C-suite is a call to action for women's leadership.

These proteins, which prevent the fish's blood from freezing in the freezing waters of Antarctica, have been found to also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals in their veins for most of their lives, which could potentially be life-threatening.\n\nResearchers from the University of Oregon and the University of Illinois conducted a study to investigate the melting point of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. They found that the ice crystals resist melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point, and that the fish can even carry ice crystals in their bodies at temperatures above 1°C above the melting point.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. This means that the fish's bodies may be unable to rid themselves of the ice crystals, even in warmer temperatures.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the fish may have evolved a mechanism to clear the ice crystals from their circulation, but this is still unknown. The study also highlights the potential risks of carrying ice crystals in the fish's bodies, including the possibility of life-threatening blockages in small blood vessels.\n\nThe discovery provides new insights into the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the trade-offs that come with them.
