While the initial mission to demystify the workplace for girls has been accomplished, it is now time to take them to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, to encourage them to become leaders. The current rate of women in top leadership positions is stagnant, with women making up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo bridge this gap, companies need to shift their focus from simply showing girls what an office looks like to providing them with role models, explaining what leaders do, and supporting programs that identify and groom female talent. Introducing girls to female role models, such as CEOs and executive officers, can make a significant difference. Companies can also provide sponsorship, which involves using one's political capital to support protégés, rather than just offering advice.\n\nThe Girl Scouts' recent study found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action at the workplace. By highlighting the accomplishments of female leaders and providing opportunities for girls to interact with them, companies can help close this gap.\n\nPrinceton University's efforts to increase female representation in leadership roles are a model for other institutions. The university's faculty started proactively encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\nIn conclusion, taking our daughters to the C-suite is a call to action for women's leadership.

These proteins, which prevent the fish's blood from freezing in the freezing waters of Antarctica, have been found to also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals in their veins for most of their lives, which could potentially be life-threatening.\n\nResearchers from the University of Oregon and the University of Illinois conducted a study to investigate the melting point of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. They found that the ice crystals resist melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point, and that the fish can even carry ice crystals in their bodies at temperatures above 1°C above the melting point.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. This means that the fish's bodies may be unable to rid themselves of the ice crystals, even in warmer temperatures.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the fish may have evolved a mechanism to clear the ice crystals from their circulation, but this is still unknown. The study also highlights the potential risks of carrying ice crystals in the fish's bodies, including the possibility of life-threatening blockages in small blood vessels.\n\nThe discovery provides new insights into the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the trade-offs that come with them.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and experts are urging the council to take action to protect the sardine population. The PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and sharks struggling to find food. The sardine fishing industry is also suffering, with fishermen reporting low catches and some environmental groups advocating for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe cause of the decline is unclear, but scientists point to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. This has repelled sardines, which are typically found in warmer waters. The decline has been so severe that the population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has also taken a dive.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with its numbers fluctuating wildly in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The species has a history of collapse and rebound, with the most recent collapse occurring in the 1950s. The current decline is the steepest since then, and experts warn that if sardines don't recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years.\n\nForage fish, including sardines, are a crucial component of the ocean food web, providing energy for predators and supporting commercial fisheries. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force estimates that forage fish worldwide are worth $11.3 billion when left in the water, compared to $5.6 billion when caught. The PFMC should prioritize the conservation of forage fish to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean ecosystem.\n\nFor more information, please visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish or contact the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

However, a closer look at his legacy reveals a complex and controversial figure. Sharon was a key player in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 50,000 civilians and the destruction of entire neighborhoods. He was also responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacres, in which Israeli-backed Christian militias killed nearly 1,400 Palestinian and Lebanese civilians.\n\nSharon's actions were often characterized by a disregard for human life and a willingness to use violence to achieve his goals. He was known for his brutal tactics, including the slaughter of innocent civilians, and his refusal to accept the legitimacy of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation.\n\nDespite his controversial past, Sharon's later years saw a shift towards a more moderate approach. He became a proponent of a two-state solution and withdrew Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. However, his vision for peace was met with skepticism and disappointment, and his legacy remains a subject of debate.\n\nIn a recent op-ed, Henry Kissinger, a former Secretary of State, wrote that Sharon's vision for peace was a \"sacrifice on behalf of raising prospects for a lasting peace.\" He noted that Sharon's willingness to cede territory and make concessions was a crucial step towards achieving peace, but that the result was ultimately disappointing.\n\nIn contrast, another op-ed, written by a critic of Sharon's, argued that his legacy was one of violence, deception, and destruction. The author pointed to Sharon's role in the Sabra and Shatila massacres and his use of the term \"terrorism\" to demean Palestinian resistance as evidence of his lack of commitment to peace.\n\nOverall, the legacy of Ariel Sharon is complex and multifaceted. While some see him as a peacemaker who made significant concessions towards achieving peace, others view him as a war criminal who was responsible for countless deaths and destruction.

For example, 65% of former vegetarians and vegans reported transitioning to their diet in just a few days or weeks, which may not be sustainable in the long term. Additionally, 58% of former vegetarians cited health as the main motivator for quitting their diet, while 58% of current vegetarians cited multiple reasons for being vegetarian, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health.\n\nThe study also found that relationships play a significant role in people's decisions to adopt or give up a vegetarian or vegan diet. For example, 33% of former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarian or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. The study suggests that advocates should focus on promoting a reduction in animal product consumption rather than complete elimination, as this may be more effective in creating a decline in animal product consumption.\n\nIn a personal account, a former vegetarian shares their experience of giving up a vegetarian diet and returning to eating meat.

The study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Pew Charitable Trusts, analyzed data from 2010-2011 and found that most of these unnecessary prescriptions are for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, and flu.\n\nThe study also found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the US result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions. However, half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many of these conditions are viral and do not require antibiotics.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has serious consequences, including the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can lead to life-threatening infections.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times.

{"pred": "A recent study by Pecan Street Research Institute has challenged the conventional wisdom that solar panels should face south to maximize energy production. The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that solar panels facing west produced 2% more electricity in a day and generated more electricity during peak demand hours, reducing grid dependence by 65% compared to 54% for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels are more effective at capturing energy during the late afternoon, when energy demand is typically highest. This is because the sun sets in the west during the summer months, coinciding with peak demand hours. The study's results also indicate that west-facing panels reduce the amount of electricity that homeowners need to draw from the grid during peak demand hours, making it easier for utility companies to manage energy supply and demand.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the residential solar market. It suggests that homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar panels, may actually be good candidates for west-facing solar panels. Additionally, the study's results could prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, which are currently not eligible for rebates.\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, it is important to note that the results may vary depending on the region and the structure of the incentives provided by utility companies. For example, in regions with different solar radiation patterns or utility companies that offer different incentives, the benefits of west-facing solar panels may be different.\n\nOverall, the study's findings highlight the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice, rather than relying solely on theoretical models.

However, subsequent searches failed to find any more individuals, and the species was largely forgotten, with only a single preserved specimen remaining.\n\nRecently, a team of researchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, led by Daniel Mulcahy, suspected that the species might still exist. They conducted an expedition to the Revillagigedo Islands, using Beebe's original field notes as a guide, and were rewarded with the rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake. The team found 11 snakes matching Beebe's description, and DNA tests confirmed that they were genetically distinct from other snakes in mainland Mexico.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant not only because it is a rare example of a species thought to be extinct, but also because it highlights the importance of preserving historical data and museum collections. The team plans to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the delicate ecosystem of the Clarion Island.\n\nThe discovery has also sparked interest in the fragility of island ecosystems, with the example of the Socorro dove, which went extinct in its natural habitat in the 1970s, but was later reintroduced through conservation efforts.

The virus was first identified in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia after laboratory workers handled African green monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then, there have been 11 reported outbreaks, with a case-fatality rate ranging from 23% to 90%.\n\n**Quarantine and Testing**\n\nAbout 99 people who came into contact with the victim have been quarantined, including 60 healthcare workers. Eleven people, including the victim's brother, have tested negative for Marburg, and those who still show symptoms will be re-tested in three days.\n\n**Transmission and Treatment**\n\nMarburg is spread through direct contact with blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, such as fruit bats. There is no specific treatment for Marburg, but hospitalized patients receive general supportive therapy, including fluid replacement and blood transfusions. Experimental treatments are being developed, similar to those for Ebola.\n\n**Outbreak History**\n\nPrevious outbreaks of Marburg have occurred in Uganda, Kenya, and Angola, with the largest outbreak in 1998 infecting 154 people and killing 128. The most recent outbreak in Uganda in 2012 infected 15 people and killed four.\n\n**Government Response**\n\nUganda's Ministry of Health has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures, and the country has experience in handling similar health threats, including Ebola. The World Health Organization has been informed, and the country's prime minister has assured that the situation is under control.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Marburg is a deadly virus, the current outbreak in Uganda is unlikely to escalate into a large-scale outbreak, given the country's experience in handling similar health threats. The government's response and the quarantine measures in place are expected to contain the spread of the virus.", "answers": ["At least 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations in Uganda so far after State House Uganda confirmed a man died this week of the Marburg virus—a type of hemorrhagic fever that's strikingly similar to Ebola, CNN reports.

A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

One possibility is that dark energy, a mysterious force that is thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be more powerful than previously thought. Another possibility is that Einstein's theory of relativity, which has been widely accepted for over a century, may be incomplete or even wrong.\n\nThe study's findings also raise questions about the nature of dark matter and dark radiation, which make up approximately 95% of the universe but do not emit light or radiation.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

However, the European Union and other creditors have warned that a \"no\" vote will have severe consequences, including the country's potential expulsion from the eurozone.\n\nThe referendum is a high-stakes gamble for Tsipras, who is betting that a \"no\" vote will give him a stronger hand to negotiate a better deal with creditors.

The move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash, and his popularity tumbled. “I don’t see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence,” says a US economist. “When you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum, this is a very deliberate move to scare people.” Tsipras initially said he would step down if the \"yes\" vote prevails, but he has since backed down from that position."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6571}

The church's leaders and members believed that plural marriage was a commandment from God, and that it was necessary for the salvation of the faithful.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced gradually, with Joseph Smith marrying multiple wives and authorizing other church members to do the same. The practice was not widely accepted by the general public, and it led to persecution and violence against the church and its members.\n\nDespite the challenges and controversies surrounding plural marriage, many church members and leaders believed that it was a necessary part of their faith and that it would bring them closer to God. The practice was seen as a way to \"raise up seed unto God\" and to fulfill the commandment to \"multiply and replenish the earth.\"\n\nThe church's leaders and members also believed that plural marriage was a way to demonstrate their faith and obedience to God, and that it would bring them blessings and protection in the next life. Many church members who practiced plural marriage reported having spiritual experiences and feelings of peace and joy as a result of their participation in the practice.\n\nIn 1890, the church's president, Wilford Woodruff, issued a manifesto that officially ended the practice of plural marriage. The church has since prohibited its members from entering into plural marriages, and has instead emphasized the importance of monogamy and the sealing of husbands and wives for eternity.\n\nToday, the church's members no longer practice plural marriage, but they continue to believe in the importance of eternal marriage and the sealing of husbands and wives for eternity.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\").

In 2013, Iranian hackers infiltrated a small New York dam, and in 2014, a group of hackers, including members from Iran, the Netherlands, Canada, and the UK, stole sensitive information about the Calpine power plants, including user names and passwords, and detailed engineering drawings of the plants' operations networks.\n\nThe attacks on the grid are not limited to large-scale utilities, as even small municipal and rural utilities have been targeted. The hackers' motivations range from financial gain to political disruption, and the consequences of a successful attack could be devastating, including widespread blackouts, economic disruption, and even loss of life.\n\nThe US government has acknowledged the threat, with the Department of Homeland Security warning industry executives in October that the Islamic State group is trying to hack American power companies. However, the government's response has been criticized for being inadequate, with many utilities still using outdated equipment and software, and lacking adequate cybersecurity measures.\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which oversees the reliability of the electrical sector, collects information about cyber incidents but keeps it confidential, and the Department of Justice has not prosecuted many cases related to grid hacking. The utilities themselves are taking steps to improve their cybersecurity, but experts say that no fortifications are foolproof, and that the threat is growing.\n\nThe article concludes that the grid is a \"lucrative target\" for hackers, and that the consequences of an attack could be catastrophic.", "answers": ["Iranian hackers who targeted American financial institutions two years ago were also apparently curious about a small dam in upstate New York—and officials are worried what this means for the security of US industrial infrastructure overall, the Wall Street Journal reports.

For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before.

The most severe form is FAS, which is characterized by facial abnormalities, growth deficiency, and central nervous system damage. FASD is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure and can result in a range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive problems.\n\n**Prevalence and Prevention**\n\nFASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. The risk of FAS is about 1.5% for women who drink any quantity of alcohol during pregnancy, and 50% for women who drink large quantities. Drinking any amount of alcohol during pregnancy can increase the risk of FAS.\n\n**History and Recognition**\n\nFAS was first identified and named in 1973 by Drs. Kenneth Lyons Jones and David Weyhe Smith. Prior to that, there were anecdotal accounts of links between maternal alcohol use and negative child outcomes, but no specific syndrome was recognized.

That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Their joint investigation found an elevated death and complication count for heart transplant patients there, whose one-year survival rate \"now ranks near the bottom nationally\" at 85% for those who got a new heart between mid-2014 and 2016; the national rate was 91.4%. Hixenbaugh and Ornstein add a face to those stats via the story of James \"Lee\" Lewis. Word came on Jan. 1, 2018, that St. Luke's had a heart for Lewis—news that brought hope the 52-year-old would be able to walk his daughter down the aisle in June. But by March 23, he was dead, having never left the hospital. What happened in between is a series of missteps, starting with the Jan. 2 transplant. Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10507}

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology.

Baum reached out to Goldberg's alleged younger sister, now Annette Block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all. Angelyne, for her part, has gone on AirTalk with host Larry Mantle to claim that the story contains \"a lot of inaccuracies\" and that the \"vindictive\" piece can never change the fact that she is \"not a woman\" but \"an icon.\" Indeed, she ran for mayor of Hollywood in 2008, per the Washington Post, and came in 28th out of 135 candidates; she also ran for governor of California in 2003 and, of course, has made numerous paid appearances at events and is the subject of a documentary.

Despite having largely the same specs as other top-of-the-line phones, the Next Web says the Note7 is \"possibly the most well-rounded, productive, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink smartphone ever made.\" The Wall Street Journal reports the Note7 is worth the hefty $850 price tag as long you plan on using the included stylus, which you absolutely should because it allows you to operate the phone underwater. For people who like their raves in numerical form, the Note7 received ratings of 9 out of 10 and 4.5 out of 5 from CNET. Wired lists some of the Note7's many selling points, including an \"absurdly good camera,\" all-time great display, \"peppy performance,\" and eye-scanning technology that allows it to be unlocked just by looking at it. Finally, the Note7 is the first big phone that \"feels like a device that was designed to be a big phone from the beginning\" and not just a stretched-out smaller phone, according to the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11500}
{"pred": "Bob Dylan, the Nobel Prize in Literature laureate, has been accused of plagiarizing portions of his Nobel lecture from SparkNotes, a study guide similar to CliffsNotes. The allegations were made by journalist Andrea Pitzer, who compared side-by-side passages of SparkNotes and Dylan's speech and found 20 passages with similar wording. For example, Dylan's quote \"There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom\" matches a passage from SparkNotes that does not appear in the novel \"Moby-Dick\". This is not the first time Dylan has faced accusations of plagiarism, with similar allegations dating back to his first album of original material in 1963. In a 2012 interview, Dylan defended his use of quotes in his work, saying \"In folk and jazz, quotation is a rich and enriching tradition. It's true for everybody, but me. There are different rules for me.\" Some critics, such as music professor Alex Lubet, argue that the use of phrases from SparkNotes in the Nobel lecture is different from the folk process and is meant to be a post-modern work of art. Others, such as cultural critic David Yaffe, do not see the alleged plagiarism as detracting from the value of the lecture and do not think the Swedish Academy will rescind Dylan's Nobel Prize.", "answers": ["Bob Dylan delivered what was described as an \"eloquent\" lecture this month as part of his Nobel prize requirements—but one writer says he may have approached the task like a high school student with an overdue project.

She says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble SparkNotes passages and compares several of them side by side. Multiple phrases, including \"Ahab's lust for vengeance,\" appear both in SparkNotes and Dylan's talk, but not in Moby Dick itself. He had to give the talk to collect $922,000 in prize money. \"Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness,\" a quote that one blogger thought Dylan had invented, appears to be based on SparkNotes. Pitzer suggests that Dylan donate some of the prize money to the SparkNotes writer, though others are more forgiving. University of Minnesota music professor Alex Lubet tells the Star-Tribune that Dylan's lecture shouldn't be treated like a classroom assignment. \"His lecture is wild and strange,\" Lubet says. \"It’s meant to be a post-modern work of art.

In a Pennsylvania case, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver at the time of a fatal accident were properly included as defendants in the case, citing a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that recognized the liability of third parties in motor vehicle accident litigation. The Pennsylvania judge's decision sets a high bar for liability, requiring that the texter knew or should have known that the recipient was driving and would view the text while on the road.\n\nThe trend towards holding texters liable is not limited to Pennsylvania. In New York, lawmakers have proposed a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that is not in accordance with state laws. The bill also proposes that drivers who refuse to hand over their phone after an accident could face a driver's license suspension.\n\nThe legal shift towards holding texters liable is not without controversy. Some argue that it could lead to a culture of fear and over-policing, while others see it as a necessary step to reduce the number of accidents caused by distracted driving. The issue is not limited to texters, as social media companies like Snapchat are also facing lawsuits for allegedly encouraging reckless behavior.\n\nThe trend towards holding texters liable is also being driven by a growing awareness of the dangers of distracted driving. According to the American Automobile Association Foundation, there were nearly 3,200 reported deaths and 431,000 injuries in the United States in 2014 due to distracted driving.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up.

The settlement included a public apology from the company to Carlson, and she agreed not to bring any further legal action against other executives at Fox News or the company itself.\n\nThe scandal has had far-reaching consequences for Fox News, with several other women coming forward to accuse Ailes of sexual harassment. The network's leadership, including James and Lachlan Murdoch, have been criticized for their handling of the crisis, with some accusing them of trying to cover up the scandal.\n\nThe scandal has also led to a wider conversation about sexual harassment and retaliation in the workplace, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency from companies and leaders. The settlement with Carlson is seen as a significant step towards addressing the issue, but many believe that more needs to be done to create a safe and respectful work environment for all employees.\n\nIn related news, Ailes's lawyer, Charles Harder, has requested that New York magazine and writer Gabriel Sherman preserve all documents related to Ailes, a possible threat of legal action in response to the magazine's article about the scandal.", "answers": ["Gretchen Carlson will take $20 million off Fox News' hands, settling on Roger Ailes' behalf in response to Carlson's sexual harassment and wrongful termination lawsuit, reports Vanity Fair.

{"pred": "The news highlights the significant gap between the pay of CEOs and workers in the United States. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, the average CEO compensation in 2017 was $18.86 million, while the median worker compensation was $19,177. This means that CEOs earned 3,101 times more than the median worker. The report also found that the pay of CEOs has been growing rapidly, with a 17.6% increase in 2017, while the pay of workers has been stagnant.\n\nThe report attributes the growing pay gap to the increasing concentration of wealth among the top 1% of earners, which has led to a decline in the share of national income going to the bottom 90%. It also notes that the pay of CEOs is not driven by their performance, but rather by their position and power.\n\nThe report suggests that the growing pay gap is not only a problem of income inequality, but also a threat to the economy. It notes that the pay of CEOs is not being driven by productivity or innovation, but rather by the concentration of wealth and power. It also suggests that the pay of CEOs is not being driven by market forces, but rather by the ability of CEOs to extract rents from the economy.\n\nThe report concludes that the growing pay gap is a result of a flawed economic system that prioritizes profits over people. It suggests that the government should take action to address the growing pay gap, such as by increasing the minimum wage, improving worker protections, and increasing taxes on the wealthy.", "answers": ["For every dollar made by the average Facebook employee, Mark Zuckerberg earned $37 in 2017.

Per the Guardian, such an \"astronomical gap\" hasn't been seen since the eve of the 2007 financial crisis. The 17.6% increase in average CEO pay, compared to 0.3% for workers, had a lot to do with a booming stock market, but it's also part of a larger trend.

{"pred": "The article explores the devastating effects of modern slot machines on gamblers, particularly those with addictive personalities. The machines, designed to deceive and manipulate players, are engineered to prey on vulnerable individuals, leading to financial ruin, family destruction, and even suicide. The story of Scott Stevens, a 52-year-old man who lost his life to his addiction, serves as a tragic example of the industry's ruthless tactics.\n\nThe machines' algorithms are designed to create an illusion of winning, with features such as \"near misses\" and \"starving reels\" that make it difficult for players to understand the actual odds of winning. The article highlights the patent application for virtual reel mapping, which was approved in 1984, and the subsequent development of machines that deliberately mislead players.\n\nThe industry's business model relies on targeting problem gamblers and addicts, who are more likely to spend large sums of money and return to the machines repeatedly. Casinos use loyalty programs, freebies, and VIP treatment to lure in these high-value customers, often with devastating consequences for their families and themselves.\n\nThe article also touches on the psychological effects of these machines, citing research that shows how the brain responds to near misses and losses disguised as wins, creating a \"smoother ride\" that can lead to addiction. The industry's lack of regulation and oversight is highlighted, with countries like Australia and New Zealand outlawing virtual reel mapping due to its harm.\n\nThe story serves as a warning about the dangers of modern slot machines and the need for stricter regulations to protect vulnerable individuals from the industry's manipulative tactics.", "answers": ["About 1% of the US population (around 3.2 million Americans) has a gambling disorder, per the National Center for Responsible Gaming—and the Atlantic tells the tragic story of one of those addicts and how a lawsuit took the entire industry to task for his death. Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

{"pred": "A recent study published in the journal Translational Psychiatry has found that men who delay starting a family are more likely to have \"geekier\" sons. The study, conducted by researchers at King's College London, analyzed data from 15,000 twins and found that sons of older fathers scored higher on a \"Geek Index\" which measures non-verbal IQ, focus on a subject, and social aloofness. The study also found that daughters of older fathers did not show the same trend, and that the mother's age had no impact on the results.\n\nThe researchers used a composite measure of non-verbal intelligence, restrictive interests, and reduced need to fit in with the peer group to compute the Geek Index. They found that the higher the Geek Index score, the better the child performed in school, particularly in STEM subjects.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Magdalena Janecka, emphasized that the findings do not mean that men should delay starting a family to increase the chances of having a \"geeky\" child. She noted that older parents are at a higher risk of conceiving children with genetic disorders and that individual families should not make decisions based on these findings.\n\nThe study's results are intriguing, as they suggest that delayed parenthood could lead to a society of geniuses who can help solve the world's problems. However, the researchers also noted that some genetic traits inherited from older fathers could be linked to both geekiness and autism.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that the trend towards delayed parenthood could lead to a society of geniuses, while others caution that the risks associated with older parenthood should not be ignored.", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
