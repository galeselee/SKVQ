At the age of 27, Sears completed a 702-mile trek through harsh Antarctic conditions, including 150mph winds and temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe journey, which took 38 days, was filled with challenges such as navigating crevasses, some of which were riddled with danger due to the risk of falling into them. Sears, who is from east London, had to adapt by using skis to cross the ice instead of being roped to a teammate.\n\nThe most dangerous part of the journey was the initial section from Hercules Inlet where sea ice meets land. Sears experienced a particularly challenging day on Christmas Eve, just 38km (24 miles) from his destination, where he hit a wall and struggled to continue. However, he managed to push through with some food, music, and motivation, eventually reaching the South Pole on Christmas Day.\n\nSears' journey ended in a significant personal achievement, but also a significant contribution to the Gurkha Welfare Trust. He raised over £33,500 for the organization, which will be used to rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, that were destroyed in the 2015 earthquake.\n\nJudy Murray, Andy's mother, congratulated Sears on his achievement, while Sears himself expressed his excitement and relief at having completed the journey. He is looking forward to some well-deserved rest, including a shower and food, after spending nearly six weeks alone in a tent.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books, but his accomplishment is undoubtedly a testament to his resilience, determination, and physical endurance.", "answers": ["While many people were unwrapping gifts on Christmas Day, the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray was wrapping up a 700-mile, 38-day journey through brutally cold temps and blistering winds—and, he hopes, setting a world record.

Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest.
