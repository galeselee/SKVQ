Sears, who is from east London, had to adapt by using skis to cross the ice instead of being roped to a teammate.\n\nThe most dangerous part of the journey was the initial section from Hercules Inlet where sea ice meets land. Sears experienced a particularly challenging day on Christmas Eve, just 38km (24 miles) from his destination, where he hit a wall and struggled to continue. However, he managed to push through with some food, music, and motivation, eventually reaching the South Pole on Christmas Day.\n\nSears' journey ended in a significant personal achievement, but also a significant contribution to the Gurkha Welfare Trust.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. These proteins, which prevent freezing by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals, also inhibit the melting of ice. This means that even during summer warming episodes, the ice in the fishes' bodies may not reliably melt, potentially leading to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\n\nIn a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified AFPs, and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 h, and at a lower temperature for at least several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes.\n\nHowever, over a long-term temperature record (1999–2012) in a shallow benthic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. This suggests that summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice due to the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition.\n\nIn a separate study, researchers found that notothenioid fishes must tolerate ice in their veins as a trade-off for the benefit of avoiding frozen blood. If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, the ice crystals are likely to melt. However, the team found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely exceed these temperatures, meaning that these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives. This could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams inside small capillaries.\n\nThe ice crystals were found to primarily reside in the fishes' spleens, and it is possible that the spleen may have a mechanism to clear the ice from", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for various species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish like salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits for sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline in sardine population is a cause for concern, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000.\n\nThe sardine fishing boat Eileen, in a reflection of the current situation, returned to port without a catch after 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel. The steep decline in sardine population is attributed to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a naturally occurring climate cycle that has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. However, the exact cause of the decline is unclear, and the crash is raising alarm among experts.\n\nIf sardines do not recover soon, the marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen of the West Coast could suffer for years. Some experts argue that continuing to fish for sardines could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, with numbers wildly unpredictable and surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment.\n\nResearchers are debating the extent to which ocean conditions and overfishing have contributed to the current decline. They also suggest that the scarcity of prey, particularly fatty sardines, could be the leading cause of the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013.\n\nFor further information and to voice concerns, individuals are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish and write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

Heather Sullivan was approached by a \"tall, skinny man\" outside her home at around 5:30 one morning in January. The man grabbed her arm, causing her to drop a lamp, which broke, alerting her boyfriend. The man then fled.

{"pred": "Title: Controversial Comedy \"Get Hard\" Faces Backlash Over Racial and Homosexual Stereotypes, While Internet Archive Receives Continuous Data Donations from Alexa Internet\n\nIn the world of film, the Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart comedy \"Get Hard\" has stirred up a storm at the South By Southwest Film Festival. The movie, which premiered last week, has been criticized for its portrayal of racial stereotypes and homophobic humor. Audiences and critics have voiced concerns about the film's depiction of a hedge fund manager (Ferrell) hiring a law-abiding acquaintance (Hart) to prepare him for maximum security prison, with much of the comedy revolving around Ferrell's character's fears of being raped in prison, including an attempt to have oral sex with a gay man in a bathroom stall.\n\nThe film's creators, including director Ethan Cohen, writers Jay Martel and Ian Roberts, and longtime collaborator Adam McKay, have defended the movie as a satire of stereotypes, not a representation of them. They argue that the characters are meant to challenge and provoke, mirroring societal attitudes and misconceptions. However, the harsh judgments and questions about the movie's handling of homosexuality have drawn attention, with headlines in The Los Angeles Times and other media outlets.\n\nMeanwhile, in the digital realm, Alexa Internet has been consistently donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996. This data, which flows in daily, is added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This long-standing partnership between Alexa Internet and the Internet Archive ensures that a vast amount of web data is preserved for future generations. This news serves as a reminder of the ongoing efforts to preserve the internet's history, while the controversy surrounding \"Get Hard\" highlights the ongoing debate about representation and stereotypes in mainstream media.\n\nIn the end, the success of \"Get Hard\" at the box office and the long-term impact of its controversial content remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the Internet Archive continues to receive valuable data donations from Alexa Internet, contributing to the preservation of the internet's history.", "answers": ["Will Ferrell's latest comedy about a wealthy white guy who enlists a law-abiding black man to help him prepare for life in prison is proving more controversial than his usual work. With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today. The film's \"jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness.\" And though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \"Unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.\" It \"seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison. At least \"Ferrell and Hart have a genial, easygoing chemistry,\" Hornaday writes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1518}
