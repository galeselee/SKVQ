Sears, who is from east London, had to adapt by using skis to cross the ice instead of being roped to a teammate.\n\nThe most dangerous part of the journey was the initial section from Hercules Inlet where sea ice meets land. Sears experienced a particularly challenging day on Christmas Eve, just 38km (24 miles) from his destination, where he hit a wall and struggled to continue. However, he managed to push through with some food, music, and motivation, eventually reaching the South Pole on Christmas Day.\n\nSears' journey ended in a significant personal achievement, but also a significant contribution to the Gurkha Welfare Trust.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. These proteins, which prevent freezing by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals, also inhibit the melting of ice. This means that even during summer warming episodes, the ice in the fishes' bodies may not reliably melt, potentially leading to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\n\nIn a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified AFPs, and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 h, and at a lower temperature for at least several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes.\n\nHowever, over a long-term temperature record (1999–2012) in a shallow benthic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. This suggests that summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice due to the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition.\n\nIn a separate study, researchers found that notothenioid fishes must tolerate ice in their veins as a trade-off for the benefit of avoiding frozen blood. If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, the ice crystals are likely to melt. However, the team found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely exceed these temperatures, meaning that these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives. This could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams inside small capillaries.\n\nThe ice crystals were found to primarily reside in the fishes' spleens, and it is possible that the spleen may have a mechanism to clear the ice from", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for various species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish like salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits for sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline in sardine population is a cause for concern, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000.\n\nThe sardine fishing boat Eileen, in a reflection of the current situation, returned to port without a catch after 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel. The steep decline in sardine population is attributed to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a naturally occurring climate cycle that has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. However, the exact cause of the decline is unclear, and the crash is raising alarm among experts.\n\nIf sardines do not recover soon, the marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen of the West Coast could suffer for years. Some experts argue that continuing to fish for sardines could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, with numbers wildly unpredictable and surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment.\n\nResearchers are debating the extent to which ocean conditions and overfishing have contributed to the current decline. They also suggest that the scarcity of prey, particularly fatty sardines, could be the leading cause of the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013.\n\nFor further information and to voice concerns, individuals are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish and write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The CDC, in partnership with The Pew Charitable Trusts, conducted a study that found approximately 30% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. are unnecessary. This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, identified acute respiratory conditions as key drivers of antibiotic overuse. The findings underscore the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, often referred to as \"superbugs.\"\n\nThe White House's national action plan for combating antibiotic resistance includes a goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020. Based on the study's findings, this goal would be met by reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15%, resulting in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.\n\nHealthcare providers, patients, and the healthcare industry as a whole can take action to address this issue.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm) compared to south-facing panels. This translates to a 65% reduction in electricity demand from the grid during peak hours for homes with west-facing solar panels, compared to a 54% reduction for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels could be more effective for many homeowners, particularly those with lifestyles that result in increased energy usage in the late afternoon. This is because west-facing panels capture solar energy more effectively during the time when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which coincides with the utility company's peak demand.\n\nThe study's results have the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, as it opens up the possibility for homeowners with west-facing roofs to take advantage of solar energy more effectively than those with south-facing roofs. It also raises questions about the current practices of utility companies, which often refuse to offer rebates for west-facing solar panels.\n\nThe findings of the Pecan Street study are not entirely surprising, as a California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing solar systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load compared to south-facing ones.

Additionally, the structure of incentives provided by utility companies may also impact the orientation of solar panels.

His death has sparked speculation about the role reality TV may have played in his demise, as his participation in the show seemed to exacerbate his marital issues with his estranged wife, Taylor Armstrong. The couple's relationship was tumultuous, with Taylor accusing Russell of physical abuse during their divorce proceedings. Russell's friend, Tom Vickers, revealed that he had confided in him about feeling that reality TV had ruined his life just days before his death.\n\nRussell's financial troubles and the pressure to maintain a certain lifestyle portrayed on the show were also factors contributing to his distress. Reports suggest that he was facing a $1.5 million lawsuit for allegedly bilking people in an Internet medical scam, and he was reportedly struggling to support the lavish lifestyle expected of him on the show.\n\nIn addition to these issues, there are unconfirmed rumors that Russell had secrets about his sexuality that were about to be revealed in a tell-all book. Sources close to Russell claim that he was bisexual and had been spending time on a gay dating website, as well as engaging in S&M activities.

The study found that for women with early-stage breast cancer who meet certain criteria, removing cancerous nodes does not improve survival rates, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or change the treatment plan. This discovery could affect around 40,000 women in the United States annually.\n\nThe study, which was funded by the National Cancer Institute, involved 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer (T1 or T2) who had undergone biopsies of one or two armpit nodes, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during a physical exam. The women in the study had lumpectomies, radiation to the entire breast, and either chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs.\n\nAfter the initial node biopsy, the women were randomly assigned to have 10 or more nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. The study found that over time, there was no difference in survival rates between the two groups, with more than 90% surviving at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1%.\n\nThe study's findings are part of a trend towards less radical surgery for breast cancer, as doctors now understand that the disease can spread early and that surgery alone may not eradicate it. The modern approach is to remove obvious tumors and use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other areas.\n\nThe study's results do not apply to all patients, but only to those with early-stage breast cancer that meets the criteria. The study's authors suggest that taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough for these patients, rather than the traditional practice of removing many nodes.\n\nThe study's findings are expected to change medical practice for many patients, but experts warn that the belief in removing nodes is deeply ingrained and widespread change may take time. Some centers, like Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, have already changed their practice based on the new information.\n\nThe study's authors emphasize that women will still need at least one lymph node removed to look for cancer and decide on further treatment.

The first report, published in the journal Nature, indicates that Antarctica is shedding ice at a rate of approximately 200 billion tonnes per year, a three-fold increase since 2012. This ice loss is causing global sea levels to rise by 0.6mm annually, with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula experiencing the most significant losses. The losses in West Antarctica have climbed from 53 billion to 159 billion tonnes per year, while the Antarctic Peninsula has seen an increase from seven billion to 33 billion tonnes annually. East Antarctica, the largest part of the continent, is the only region showing some growth, but it is minimal, running at about five billion tonnes per year.\n\nThe second report, released by an international team of ice experts, states that Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, with the southern-most continent's ice sheet melting enough to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet (4 meters). This melting has caused global oceans to rise by three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). The study, which includes 88 co-authors, used 10 to 15 satellites, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations to analyze ice loss in 24 different ways.\n\nThe third report, also published in Nature, suggests that the East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2 million to 5 million years ago, even when heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels were similar to what they are now. This finding contradicts the idea that East Antarctica might be unstable in a warming climate.\n\nThese reports highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating ice loss in Antarctica when planning future defenses for low-lying coastal communities.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route.

As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60.

The efforts have been challenging, with workers battling against time, radiation, and the complex's damaged infrastructure. As of now, four reactors have seen fires, explosions, or partial meltdowns, and temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other reactors.\n\nThe situation at the plant has been a source of concern for both Japanese and international authorities. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recommended a 50-mile evacuation zone for American citizens, a much wider measure than the 20-kilometer evacuation zone established by Japan. The U.S. has also offered technical help and intelligence-collection aircraft to aid Japan in managing the crisis.\n\nThe Japanese government has been criticized for its handling of the crisis, with some officials suggesting that the Tokyo Electric Power Company has underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage. The crisis has also led to a review of nuclear safety in the United States, with President Obama ordering a comprehensive review of nuclear plants in the country.\n\nThe humanitarian aftermath of the natural disasters has been equally devastating, with over 7,000 people confirmed dead or missing, and hundreds of thousands displaced. The plight of the homeless, many of whom are elderly, has worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the affected areas. Aid groups have reported that many victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering.\n\nIn response to the nuclear crisis, the Group", "answers": ["Japan is considering burying its troubled nuclear plant in sand and concrete—the same move made in Chernobyl 25 years ago, Reuters reports. “It is not impossible to encase the reactors in concrete.

The researchers have not observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the gravitational influence it has on smaller objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe proposed planet, if confirmed, would reconfigure our understanding of the solar system's structure. Pluto, which was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to its size and orbit, may once again face reevaluation as a planet if Planet Nine is found. Mike Brown, one of the researchers, is known as the \"Pluto Killer\" for his role in Pluto's demotion. He has stated that he may have to rewrite textbooks again if Planet Nine is confirmed.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents looking for the elusive planet. The discovery would reaffirm the existence of the \"Pluto Killer\" title, as Brown and Batygin initially set out to disprove the possibility of a ninth planet. They have found that the gravitational effects of Planet Nine on smaller objects in the outer solar system are stronger than any other explanation for their clustering.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would also challenge the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) definition of a planet, as it would need to \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbit and have the gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects. Planet Nine fits these criteria perfectly, according to Brown.\n\nThe IAU's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has expressed caution, stating that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. However, he is excited about the new research and the potential for discovering new things about our solar system.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is expected to continue, with Brown and Batygin hoping that the publication of their research will infuse the search with new energy.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet.

Traffic is frequently disrupted, and people are afraid to venture out after dark due to the risk of kidnappings and violence. The city, once known for its vibrant nightlife, is now a city under siege, with residents worried about food and heating shortages as winter approaches.\n\nThe Alawite community, a minority sect that has been a key support base for President Bashar al-Assad, is facing increasing tension and discontent. There are rumblings of discontent within the community, with some suggesting a potential split in the Alawite clans. A shootout between members of the Assad family in Qardaha, the president's ancestral home, and the detention of a prominent Alawite activist have fueled these suspicions. However, it remains unclear whether this tension will lead to a shift in Alawite loyalty to the regime.\n\nThe Syrian economy is also suffering significantly due to the conflict. Wealthy Syrians, who have traditionally supported Assad, are seeing their businesses pummeled by the violence. Factories have been burned down or damaged, international sanctions are restricting their finances, and the gap between rich and poor is widening. Despite this, Assad has been able to keep his head above water with financial support from top allies Iran and Russia.\n\nRebel attacks on oil and gas pipelines in the northeast of the country have caused further economic damage. Activists report that airstrikes on rebel areas in Idlib and Aleppo provinces have killed at least 20 people and leveled buildings, forcing residents to dig through the rubble for survivors.\n\nIn conclusion, the civil war in Syria is taking a heavy toll on the country, with Damascus becoming a city under siege, the Alawite community facing internal tension, and the economy struggling significantly.

This event marks the culmination of a nine-and-a-half-year journey from Earth, covering 4.67 billion miles. Pluto, a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, is the last unexplored world in the solar system. The spacecraft will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto's surface, providing unprecedented close-up images and data.\n\nPluto is larger than previously thought, measuring approximately 2,370 kilometers across, with its largest moon, Charon, being 1,208 kilometers in diameter. The increased size means Pluto contains more ice and less rock beneath its surface than expected. New Horizons has already delivered data that reveals Pluto's atmosphere extends higher than previously thought, offering insights into its atmospheric structure.\n\nThe spacecraft has already beamed back images of Pluto and Charon, showing a \"strange\" and \"alien\" beauty. These images have revealed complex and nuanced surfaces, suggesting a history for these bodies that is beyond scientists' wildest dreams. New Horizons has also detected nitrogen escaping from Pluto's tenuous atmosphere, and a hypothesized polar cap on Pluto has been confirmed as an ice cap consisting of nitrogen and methane ices.\n\nThe flyby will provide valuable insights into the origins of the solar system, as Pluto is thought to contain clues about the early solar system. The data collected by New Horizons will help refine theories about how water spread throughout the solar system, how life began on Earth, and how atmospheres of other planets function.\n\nThe flyby will take place on July 14, 2015, at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT). The spacecraft will be too busy taking photographs and collecting information to contact Earth immediately after the flyby.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

Germanwings Flight 9525 Crash: The crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, which occurred on March 24, 2015, is the focus of several news passages. Investigators believe that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, deliberately locked the captain out of the cockpit and crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder supports this theory, as it reveals Lubitz ignoring the captain's pleas to open the door and passengers' screams in the final moments before impact. The transcript of the recording was leaked to the German newspaper Bild, causing concern among investigators who believe it could compromise the ongoing investigation. The flight data recorder, which could provide crucial details about the plane's final moments, remains missing.\n\n2. Calls for Caution: In response to the leaked transcript and speculation about the crash, several organizations and individuals have called for caution in drawing conclusions about the cause of the crash. German and European pilots' associations have urged waiting for the investigation to be completed before making any definitive statements. Jean-Pierre Michel, the head of the French investigation agency, has also stated that other hypotheses, including mechanical faults, must be considered until the investigation is complete.\n\n3. Andreas Lubitz's Personal Life: Andreas Lubitz was living with a 26-year-old woman in Düsseldorf up until the crash. She worked as a teacher and had visited the crash site last week. The couple had been together since they were students and had recently ordered two new cars. It is believed that Lubitz may have crashed the plane due to his depression and vision problems that could have ended his flying career.\n\n4. Reactions to the Crash: The town of Montabaur, where Lubitz was from, held a prayer service for the victims of the crash and for Lubitz and his grieving family.

Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom. This sea-change has been coming for years now, as an old Forbes piece shows, but some—including Steven Spielberg—believe Hollywood will over-invest in blockbusters: \"There’s going to be an implosion\" where several \"mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm again,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5611}
{"pred": "In the news, we find a letter of resignation from Kate Downing, a member of the Palo Alto Planning and Transportation Commission, who is moving to Santa Cruz due to the unaffordable housing costs in Palo Alto. Downing, a corporate attorney and software engineer, has been a vocal advocate for affordable housing in Palo Alto but finds it impossible to raise a family in the city due to the high cost of housing. She criticizes the city council for ignoring the majority of residents' pleas to prioritize housing and for continuing to build more offices instead of housing.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Palo Alto is not just affecting professionals like Downing but also teachers, first responders, and service workers, causing difficulties in filling job openings in the police department and renewing teacher contracts. Downing argues that small changes such as allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-use developments, legalizing duplexes, and easing restrictions on granny units could help alleviate the housing shortage and make Palo Alto more affordable.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Palo Alto is not unique to the city, with many Peninsula towns refusing to increase housing, leading to an influx of new-moneyed arrivals in San Francisco, Oakland, and a few other areas. This trend has led to the mass exit of working-class residents, including first responders, police, teachers, and grocery store clerks.\n\nIn a related news item, we find information on how to search for properties in the Palo Alto area, including options for MLS-listed homes, foreclosures, and for-sale-by-owner homes. The search options allow users to filter by property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, lot size, parking, and year built.\n\nFinally, we learn that Palo Alto is becoming less family-oriented and more of a place for jet-setting executives and investors, with young families no longer moving to the city. The city's refusal to increase housing has led to a shift in demographics, with the city becoming less innovative and more exclusive. The city council is being criticized for ignoring the housing crisis and continuing to build offices instead of housing, leading to a spiral in housing prices throughout the Bay Area.", "answers": ["Palo Alto's planning and transportation commissioner sat down and did the math: For Kate Vershov Downing and husband Steve to purchase a home similar to the 4-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot dwelling they currently rent (with another couple, at $6,200 a month), their monthly payment would be $12,177. That's $146,127 a year on mortgage, insurance, and taxes, and that's assuming they had half-a-million dollars for a down payment. \"This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer,\" she writes; she's senior corporate counsel to a tech company and her husband works for Palantir. And so after five years of trying to make it work in Silicon Valley, the Downings, \"cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family,\" Kate writes in a public resignation letter posted Tuesday announcing her move to Santa Cruz. She tells the Mercury News that her letter \"is not supposed to be a sad story about me. ... I'm extraordinarily lucky and privileged.\" But she writes that \"it's clear that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits.\" Indeed, Curbed SF backs up its assertion that there's little on the market there for less than $1 million with a link to Redfin, which, for example, has a listing for a $729,000 house ... that's 529 square feet. In her letter, Downing—called \"one of Palo Alto's most passionate advocates for building more affordable housing\" by Palo Alto Online — takes the City Council to task for ignoring residents' clamor for significant change on the housing front; her letter repeats some of the recommendations she herself has made.

{"pred": "Former Congressman Anthony Weiner is under investigation for allegedly engaging in a months-long online sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl. The relationship, which reportedly began in January 2016, involved explicit text messages, photos, and video chats, including a Skype session where Weiner allegedly asked the girl to undress and engage in sexual activities. The girl's father and a teacher were informed about the relationship in late April.\n\nThe investigations are being conducted by the FBI and the New York Police Department, as well as the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office declined to comment on the ongoing investigations.\n\nWeiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal, has acknowledged communicating with the girl but has denied any wrongdoing. He has provided emails from the girl in which she recants her story and apologizes for lying. However, the girl has said that she wrote the emails under pressure from Weiner.\n\nWeiner is married to Huma Abedin, a close aide to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The couple has a young son together. Abedin announced in August that she was leaving Weiner after revelations of another sexting scandal.\n\nWeiner has faced scrutiny over online chats with minors in the past. In 2011, he admitted to sending five private Twitter messages to a 17-year-old girl, but said the messages were neither explicit nor indecent.\n\nThe latest scandal comes at a critical time for the Clinton campaign, with the presidential election just weeks away.

The AP reports that the former congressman's alleged online relationship with a 15-year-old girl is being investigated by authorities in New York and in North Carolina, where the girl lives. A spokeswoman for the US attorney's office in North Carolina says they've \"begun investigative efforts,\" and sources tell CNN that prosecutors in New York have already subpoenaed the 52-year-old's phone records and other communication. An FBI task force in New York is also looking into the matter, a law enforcement source says. According to the Daily Mail, which first reported Weiner's communication with the underage girl, Weiner's explicit messages included one where he told the high school sophomore he would \"make her limp for a week.\" The girl says Weiner—who allegedly called himself \"T Dog\" this time instead of \"Carlos Danger\"—asked her to undress and touch herself, and the New York Daily News notes that encouraging a child under 17 to \"engage in a sexual performance\" can carry a 15-year sentence in New York. Weiner has admitted communicating with the girl and demonstrating \"terrible judgment\" online, but he also claims to have been \"the subject of a hoax.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 6169}
