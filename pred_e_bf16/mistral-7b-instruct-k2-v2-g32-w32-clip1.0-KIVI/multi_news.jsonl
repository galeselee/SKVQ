Sears, who is from east London, had to adapt by using skis to cross the ice instead of being roped to a teammate.\n\nThe most dangerous part of the journey was the initial section from Hercules Inlet where sea ice meets land. Sears experienced a particularly challenging day on Christmas Eve, just 38km (24 miles) from his destination, where he hit a wall and struggled to continue. However, he managed to push through with some food, music, and motivation, eventually reaching the South Pole on Christmas Day.\n\nSears' journey ended in a significant personal achievement, but also a significant contribution to the Gurkha Welfare Trust.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. These proteins, which prevent freezing by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals, also inhibit the melting of ice. This means that even during summer warming episodes, the ice in the fishes' bodies may not reliably melt, potentially leading to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\n\nIn a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified AFPs, and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 h, and at a lower temperature for at least several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes.\n\nHowever, over a long-term temperature record (1999–2012) in a shallow benthic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. This suggests that summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice due to the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition.\n\nIn a separate study, researchers found that notothenioid fishes must tolerate ice in their veins as a trade-off for the benefit of avoiding frozen blood. If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, the ice crystals are likely to melt. However, the team found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely exceed these temperatures, meaning that these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives. This could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams inside small capillaries.\n\nThe ice crystals were found to primarily reside in the fishes' spleens, and it is possible that the spleen may have a mechanism to clear the ice from", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for various species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish like salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits for sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline in sardine population is a cause for concern, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000.\n\nThe sardine fishing boat Eileen, in a reflection of the current situation, returned to port without a catch after 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel. The steep decline in sardine population is attributed to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a naturally occurring climate cycle that has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. However, the exact cause of the decline is unclear, and the crash is raising alarm among experts.\n\nIf sardines do not recover soon, the marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen of the West Coast could suffer for years. Some experts argue that continuing to fish for sardines could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, with numbers wildly unpredictable and surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment.\n\nResearchers are debating the extent to which ocean conditions and overfishing have contributed to the current decline. They also suggest that the scarcity of prey, particularly fatty sardines, could be the leading cause of the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013.\n\nFor further information and to voice concerns, individuals are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish and write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The CDC, in partnership with The Pew Charitable Trusts, conducted a study that found approximately 30% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. are unnecessary. This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, identified acute respiratory conditions as key drivers of antibiotic overuse. The findings underscore the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, often referred to as \"superbugs.\"\n\nThe White House's national action plan for combating antibiotic resistance includes a goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020. Based on the study's findings, this goal would be met by reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15%, resulting in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.\n\nHealthcare providers, patients, and the healthcare industry as a whole can take action to address this issue.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm) compared to south-facing panels. This translates to a 65% reduction in electricity demand from the grid during peak hours for homes with west-facing solar panels, compared to a 54% reduction for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels could be more effective for many homeowners, particularly those with lifestyles that result in increased energy usage in the late afternoon. This is because west-facing panels capture solar energy more effectively during the time when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which coincides with the utility company's peak demand.\n\nThe study's results have the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, as it opens up the possibility for homeowners with west-facing roofs to take advantage of solar energy more effectively than those with south-facing roofs. It also raises questions about the current practices of utility companies, which often refuse to offer rebates for west-facing solar panels.\n\nThe findings of the Pecan Street study are not entirely surprising, as a California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing solar systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load compared to south-facing ones.

Additionally, the structure of incentives provided by utility companies may also impact the orientation of solar panels.

His death has sparked speculation about the role reality TV may have played in his demise, as his participation in the show seemed to exacerbate his marital issues with his estranged wife, Taylor Armstrong. The couple's relationship was tumultuous, with Taylor accusing Russell of physical abuse during their divorce proceedings. Russell's friend, Tom Vickers, revealed that he had confided in him about feeling that reality TV had ruined his life just days before his death.\n\nRussell's financial troubles and the pressure to maintain a certain lifestyle portrayed on the show were also factors contributing to his distress. Reports suggest that he was facing a $1.5 million lawsuit for allegedly bilking people in an Internet medical scam, and he was reportedly struggling to support the lavish lifestyle expected of him on the show.\n\nIn addition to these issues, there are unconfirmed rumors that Russell had secrets about his sexuality that were about to be revealed in a tell-all book. Sources close to Russell claim that he was bisexual and had been spending time on a gay dating website, as well as engaging in S&M activities.

The study found that for women with early-stage breast cancer who meet certain criteria, removing cancerous nodes does not improve survival rates, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or change the treatment plan. This discovery could affect around 40,000 women in the United States annually.\n\nThe study, which was funded by the National Cancer Institute, involved 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer (T1 or T2) who had undergone biopsies of one or two armpit nodes, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during a physical exam. The women in the study had lumpectomies, radiation to the entire breast, and either chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs.\n\nAfter the initial node biopsy, the women were randomly assigned to have 10 or more nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. The study found that over time, there was no difference in survival rates between the two groups, with more than 90% surviving at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1%.\n\nThe study's findings are part of a trend towards less radical surgery for breast cancer, as doctors now understand that the disease can spread early and that surgery alone may not eradicate it. The modern approach is to remove obvious tumors and use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other areas.\n\nThe study's results do not apply to all patients, but only to those with early-stage breast cancer that meets the criteria. The study's authors suggest that taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough for these patients, rather than the traditional practice of removing many nodes.\n\nThe study's findings are expected to change medical practice for many patients, but experts warn that the belief in removing nodes is deeply ingrained and widespread change may take time. Some centers, like Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, have already changed their practice based on the new information.\n\nThe study's authors emphasize that women will still need at least one lymph node removed to look for cancer and decide on further treatment.

The first report, published in the journal Nature, indicates that Antarctica is shedding ice at a rate of approximately 200 billion tonnes per year, a three-fold increase since 2012. This ice loss is causing global sea levels to rise by 0.6mm annually, with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula experiencing the most significant losses. The losses in West Antarctica have climbed from 53 billion to 159 billion tonnes per year, while the Antarctic Peninsula has seen an increase from seven billion to 33 billion tonnes annually. East Antarctica, the largest part of the continent, is the only region showing some growth, but it is minimal, running at about five billion tonnes per year.\n\nThe second report, released by an international team of ice experts, states that Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, with the southern-most continent's ice sheet melting enough to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet (4 meters). This melting has caused global oceans to rise by three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). The study, which includes 88 co-authors, used 10 to 15 satellites, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations to analyze ice loss in 24 different ways.\n\nThe third report, also published in Nature, suggests that the East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2 million to 5 million years ago, even when heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels were similar to what they are now. This finding contradicts the idea that East Antarctica might be unstable in a warming climate.\n\nThese reports highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating ice loss in Antarctica when planning future defenses for low-lying coastal communities.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route.

As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60.

The efforts have been challenging, with workers battling against time, radiation, and the complex's damaged infrastructure. As of now, four reactors have seen fires, explosions, or partial meltdowns, and temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other reactors.\n\nThe situation at the plant has been a source of concern for both Japanese and international authorities. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recommended a 50-mile evacuation zone for American citizens, a much wider measure than the 20-kilometer evacuation zone established by Japan. The U.S. has also offered technical help and intelligence-collection aircraft to aid Japan in managing the crisis.\n\nThe Japanese government has been criticized for its handling of the crisis, with some officials suggesting that the Tokyo Electric Power Company has underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage. The crisis has also led to a review of nuclear safety in the United States, with President Obama ordering a comprehensive review of nuclear plants in the country.\n\nThe humanitarian aftermath of the natural disasters has been equally devastating, with over 7,000 people confirmed dead or missing, and hundreds of thousands displaced. The plight of the homeless, many of whom are elderly, has worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the affected areas. Aid groups have reported that many victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering.\n\nIn response to the nuclear crisis, the Group", "answers": ["Japan is considering burying its troubled nuclear plant in sand and concrete—the same move made in Chernobyl 25 years ago, Reuters reports. “It is not impossible to encase the reactors in concrete.

The researchers have not observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the gravitational influence it has on smaller objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe proposed planet, if confirmed, would reconfigure our understanding of the solar system's structure. Pluto, which was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to its size and orbit, may once again face reevaluation as a planet if Planet Nine is found. Mike Brown, one of the researchers, is known as the \"Pluto Killer\" for his role in Pluto's demotion. He has stated that he may have to rewrite textbooks again if Planet Nine is confirmed.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents looking for the elusive planet. The discovery would reaffirm the existence of the \"Pluto Killer\" title, as Brown and Batygin initially set out to disprove the possibility of a ninth planet. They have found that the gravitational effects of Planet Nine on smaller objects in the outer solar system are stronger than any other explanation for their clustering.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would also challenge the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) definition of a planet, as it would need to \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbit and have the gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects. Planet Nine fits these criteria perfectly, according to Brown.\n\nThe IAU's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has expressed caution, stating that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. However, he is excited about the new research and the potential for discovering new things about our solar system.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is expected to continue, with Brown and Batygin hoping that the publication of their research will infuse the search with new energy.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet.

Traffic is frequently disrupted, and people are afraid to venture out after dark due to the risk of kidnappings and violence. The city, once known for its vibrant nightlife, is now a city under siege, with residents worried about food and heating shortages as winter approaches.\n\nThe Alawite community, a minority sect that has been a key support base for President Bashar al-Assad, is facing increasing tension and discontent. There are rumblings of discontent within the community, with some suggesting a potential split in the Alawite clans. A shootout between members of the Assad family in Qardaha, the president's ancestral home, and the detention of a prominent Alawite activist have fueled these suspicions. However, it remains unclear whether this tension will lead to a shift in Alawite loyalty to the regime.\n\nThe Syrian economy is also suffering significantly due to the conflict. Wealthy Syrians, who have traditionally supported Assad, are seeing their businesses pummeled by the violence. Factories have been burned down or damaged, international sanctions are restricting their finances, and the gap between rich and poor is widening. Despite this, Assad has been able to keep his head above water with financial support from top allies Iran and Russia.\n\nRebel attacks on oil and gas pipelines in the northeast of the country have caused further economic damage. Activists report that airstrikes on rebel areas in Idlib and Aleppo provinces have killed at least 20 people and leveled buildings, forcing residents to dig through the rubble for survivors.\n\nIn conclusion, the civil war in Syria is taking a heavy toll on the country, with Damascus becoming a city under siege, the Alawite community facing internal tension, and the economy struggling significantly.

This event marks the culmination of a nine-and-a-half-year journey from Earth, covering 4.67 billion miles. Pluto, a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, is the last unexplored world in the solar system. The spacecraft will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto's surface, providing unprecedented close-up images and data.\n\nPluto is larger than previously thought, measuring approximately 2,370 kilometers across, with its largest moon, Charon, being 1,208 kilometers in diameter. The increased size means Pluto contains more ice and less rock beneath its surface than expected. New Horizons has already delivered data that reveals Pluto's atmosphere extends higher than previously thought, offering insights into its atmospheric structure.\n\nThe spacecraft has already beamed back images of Pluto and Charon, showing a \"strange\" and \"alien\" beauty. These images have revealed complex and nuanced surfaces, suggesting a history for these bodies that is beyond scientists' wildest dreams. New Horizons has also detected nitrogen escaping from Pluto's tenuous atmosphere, and a hypothesized polar cap on Pluto has been confirmed as an ice cap consisting of nitrogen and methane ices.\n\nThe flyby will provide valuable insights into the origins of the solar system, as Pluto is thought to contain clues about the early solar system. The data collected by New Horizons will help refine theories about how water spread throughout the solar system, how life began on Earth, and how atmospheres of other planets function.\n\nThe flyby will take place on July 14, 2015, at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT). The spacecraft will be too busy taking photographs and collecting information to contact Earth immediately after the flyby.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

Germanwings Flight 9525 Crash: The crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, which occurred on March 24, 2015, is the focus of several news passages. Investigators believe that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, deliberately locked the captain out of the cockpit and crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder supports this theory, as it reveals Lubitz ignoring the captain's pleas to open the door and passengers' screams in the final moments before impact. The transcript of the recording was leaked to the German newspaper Bild, causing concern among investigators who believe it could compromise the ongoing investigation. The flight data recorder, which could provide crucial details about the plane's final moments, remains missing.\n\n2. Calls for Caution: In response to the leaked transcript and speculation about the crash, several organizations and individuals have called for caution in drawing conclusions about the cause of the crash. German and European pilots' associations have urged waiting for the investigation to be completed before making any definitive statements. Jean-Pierre Michel, the head of the French investigation agency, has also stated that other hypotheses, including mechanical faults, must be considered until the investigation is complete.\n\n3. Andreas Lubitz's Personal Life: Andreas Lubitz was living with a 26-year-old woman in Düsseldorf up until the crash. She worked as a teacher and had visited the crash site last week. The couple had been together since they were students and had recently ordered two new cars. It is believed that Lubitz may have crashed the plane due to his depression and vision problems that could have ended his flying career.\n\n4. Reactions to the Crash: The town of Montabaur, where Lubitz was from, held a prayer service for the victims of the crash and for Lubitz and his grieving family.

So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom.

Downing, a corporate attorney and software engineer, has been a vocal advocate for affordable housing in Palo Alto but finds it impossible to raise a family in the city due to the high cost of housing. She criticizes the city council for ignoring the majority of residents' pleas to prioritize housing and for continuing to build more offices instead of housing.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Palo Alto is not just affecting professionals like Downing but also teachers, first responders, and service workers, causing difficulties in filling job openings in the police department and renewing teacher contracts. Downing argues that small changes such as allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-use developments, legalizing duplexes, and easing restrictions on granny units could help alleviate the housing shortage and make Palo Alto more affordable.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Palo Alto is not unique to the city, with many Peninsula towns refusing to increase housing, leading to an influx of new-moneyed arrivals in San Francisco, Oakland, and a few other areas. This trend has led to the mass exit of working-class residents, including first responders, police, teachers, and grocery store clerks.\n\nIn a related news item, we find information on how to search for properties in the Palo Alto area, including options for MLS-listed homes, foreclosures, and for-sale-by-owner homes. The search options allow users to filter by property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, lot size, parking, and year built.\n\nFinally, we learn that Palo Alto is becoming less family-oriented and more of a place for jet-setting executives and investors, with young families no longer moving to the city.

The loss was particularly devastating as the team needed only a draw to secure a spot in the tournament.\n\nThe qualifying round, known as the Hexagonal, consists of six teams competing for three spots from the CONCACAF region. The USMNT's poor performance throughout the Hex, including losses to Costa Rica and Honduras, left them in a precarious position. A win by Panama over Costa Rica and a loss by Mexico to Honduras on the same day further complicated the situation, leaving the USMNT needing a win or a draw against Trinidad and Tobago to secure a spot.\n\nDespite the pressure, the USMNT failed to show urgency and lost 2-1 to Trinidad and Tobago, the worst team in the Hexagonal.

Historically, a husband's forcing his wife to have sex was not considered rape in many cases.

The prosecutor's interpretation of the law suggests that the spouses were no longer cohabiting because the wife was in a nursing home.\n\nThe case highlights the need for the law to consider the nature of the parties' past relationship in cases where one party is mentally incapacitated.

Brexit Crisis: The British Parliament has been plunged into crisis over the Brexit deal, with the March 29 exit date fast approaching. The deal, which aims to maintain close ties with the European Union (EU), has faced opposition from both the parliament and Eurosceptic critics within the Conservative Party. Prime Minister May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, cancelled a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal on Monday after it became clear she would lose it badly. The hardline Brexit supporters within her party triggered a no-confidence vote in her leadership hours after her return from talks with European leaders. After a two-hour voting session, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, announced that 200 Conservative lawmakers supported May, and 117 were against, indicating a bitter division within the party over the direction of Brexit.\n\n2. Confidence Vote in Theresa May: Theresa May faced a no-confidence vote from her own Conservative Party on Wednesday, following the submission of 48 letters from party members calling for a leadership contest. The result of the vote would determine May's future as the party and government leader. If she lost, she would be required to step down, and a new leader would be chosen. However, if she won, she would be protected from another challenge for a year. May made a last-minute appeal to her party, promising not to lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022, but to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal. The outcome of the vote would have significant implications for the future of Brexit, as any new leader would likely have to renegotiate the deal or face the possibility of a delay or even another referendum on EU membership. The vote results were expected later in the evening.\n\nThe Brexit crisis and the leadership vote have caused uncertainty and alarm among businesses and citizens alike, with some expressing concern about the potential economic and political consequences of a change in leadership or a delay in the Brexit process.

Monis had been fighting the validity of the charges, claiming the letters were his own version of condolence cards. He had been sentenced to 300 hours of community service and a two-year good behavior bond for the offensive letters.\n\nMonis was known to the Australian authorities for his extremist views and criminal activities.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile.

{"pred": "In the recent Independence Day weekend, the box office performance was lackluster for several new movie releases. The animated film Finding Dory continued its success, setting a record for the biggest third weekend of all time for an animated movie, while the live-action adaptations of Roald Dahl's The BFG and The Legend of Tarzan underperformed. The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Disney, was particularly disappointing, earning $22.2 million domestically and $3.9 million overseas, far below its $140 million budget.\n\nThe BFG's poor performance has sparked discussions about the reasons behind its failure. Some argue that the movie's title, which stands for Big Friendly Giant, may have been confusing for modern audiences, and the lack of recognizable stars might have hindered its marketing. Others suggest that the film's release was poorly timed, as it was overshadowed by the ongoing success of Finding Dahlia.\n\nDespite the disappointing box office results, critics praised the film's visual effects, particularly the performance of Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant, and the emotional bond between the giant and the young girl, Sophie. However, the film's mixed reviews and the lack of a strong connection with the audience may have contributed to its poor performance.\n\nThe BFG's failure marks a rare instance of a commercial venture by Steven Spielberg that did not succeed at the box office. While the director has had a few box office disappointments in the past, such as Hook and Hook 1941, The BFG is the first such film that was intended as a crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster.\n\nDespite the setback, both Spielberg and Disney are expected to recover with their upcoming projects. Spielberg is set to direct Ready Player One, based on a popular novel, while Disney continues to enjoy success with its recent releases. The BFG's failure, however, raises questions about the appeal of children's book adaptations and the potential decline of the summer blockbuster era.", "answers": ["With a $140 million budget and an opening weekend take of only $24 million, The BFG is poised to be Steven Spielberg's biggest flop in 37 years, Rolling Stone reports. That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The strike was the first time the U.S. has directly targeted Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. The attack was condemned by Syria, Iran, and Russia, but welcomed by the Syrian opposition and other world leaders, including the U.S. and France. The U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk missiles from the Mediterranean Sea, targeting the airstrips, hangars, control tower, ammunition areas, and runway at the Shayrat airbase. The strike was a response to the chemical attack, which the U.S. believes was launched from the airbase. The death toll from the strike was reported to be at least seven, including a general and three soldiers. Russia condemned the strike as an act of aggression against a sovereign state and suspended its cooperation with the U.S. in Syria's congested skies. The U.S. strike was supported by many world leaders, including the U.K., France, and Germany, who called for a political solution to the Syrian conflict. The U.S. did not seek congressional approval for the strike, but some members of Congress, such as Senators Rand Paul and Ted Lieu, raised concerns about the legality of the strike. The strike was also supported by Saudi Arabia and Israel, while Iran called it a dangerous and unilateral action that would strengthen terrorists. The Syrian National Coalition, a Syrian opposition group, called the U.S. missile attack a turning point and a step towards ending the impunity of the Syrian regime. The U.S. had initially focused on diplomatic efforts to address the chemical attack, but the U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution drafted with the U.K. and France was canceled due to differences among the members.

Al-Baghdadi claims that the ties between Al Qaeda and Al-Nusra were kept secret for security reasons and to allow Syrians to judge the jihadist fighters independently.\n\nThe merger will complicate the arming of Syrian rebels by Gulf powers, as Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been supplying weapons to brigades affiliated with the Free Syrian Army, with the intention of shifting the balance of the war in favor of the rebels. However, videos posted by Al-Nusra show their fighters using Croatian anti-tank weapons, which are believed to have been earmarked for the FSA. European nations have resisted arming the Syrian rebels due to concerns that the equipment would fall into the hands of jihadist groups such as Al-Nusra.\n\nThe merger has been met with tension within the newly announced alliance, as the leader of Al-Nusra, Abu Mohammad al-Golani, has only pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and not officially merged the group with Al Qaeda in Iraq. Al-Golani stated that he was not consulted about the merger and only heard about it through the media.

The project, titled Self-Managed Abortion, Safe and Supported (SASS), connects US women with counselors who can provide step-by-step instructions and answer questions in real-time.\n\nThe project is inspired by the growing number of US women who may already be taking matters into their own hands as abortion options contract. The counselors are trained by medical professionals to walk women through the process of using misoprostol for a DIY abortion and will also strive to connect women with abortion funds if payment is the main obstacle for getting an abortion in a clinic.\n\nThe legal risks of the project are far from certain, as the act of looking for or giving out information about self-induced abortion is protected by law, but could potentially compound the legal risks for women who have been charged for self-induced abortions in the past.

He encouraged other Republican candidates to consider following his lead to help clear the field and focus on a positive, conservative message to challenge the current front-runner, Donald Trump.\n\nWalker's exit from the race was not a surprise, as his campaign had been struggling for months. His poll numbers had dropped significantly, and he faced financial difficulties due to a lack of hard dollars to pay for staff, travel, and filing fees. The money dried up, according to sources, after the Cleveland debate in August, and it could not be replenished.\n\nThe competition for Walker's supporters and resources intensified after his announcement. Several campaigns, including those of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush, reached out to Walker's team members and donors. Bush, in particular, expressed interest in winning over Walker's Iowa organization, which had leaders in each of the state's 99 counties.\n\nWalker's departure from the race leaves the field with 15 candidates. The 2016 presidential campaign has been marked by a toxic environment, with personal attacks and negative campaigning. Walker, who portrayed himself as a regular-guy champion of the GOP's burn-the-Beltway base, struggled to find his footing in this environment. He was criticized for his handling of core Republican issues, especially birthright citizenship, and was seen as too confident in his abilities, acting as his own campaign manager.\n\nWalker's campaign was also hampered by his inability to educate himself quickly on issues outside of his remit and his tendency to use tics such as instinctively answering \"yes\" and \"absolutely\" to questions.

Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders.

Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports.

The unmasking of these names was part of incidental electronic surveillance of Donald Trump, his family, and associates for up to a year before he took office. The motive behind Rice's request to unmask these names is unclear, and there is no evidence of partisan political motives behind the unmasking.\n\nRep.

This practice, foreign to Western cultural norms, was a challenging aspect of the Restoration and tested the faith of many members. Plural marriage was commanded by God in biblical times and was seen as an ancient principle restored to the Church in the latter days.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not fully understood and was introduced incrementally, with participants keeping their actions confidential. The historical record of early plural marriage is thin due to the secrecy surrounding the practice and the passage of time. The Church acknowledges that significant difficulties and misunderstandings arose as Church leaders and members heeded the command to practice plural marriage and later worked to discontinue it after the Manifesto in 1890.\n\nJoseph Smith, the founder of the Church, received a revelation on plural marriage in 1843, which was part of a larger revelation about eternal marriage. He married multiple wives and authorized other Church members to practice plural marriage. The exact number of women to whom Joseph Smith was sealed is unknown, as the evidence is fragmentary. Some of these sealings were for time and eternity, while others were for eternity only.\n\nPlural marriage benefited the Church in numerous ways, including the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes, the creation of a sense of cohesion and group identification among members, and the unification of a diverse immigrant population through ethnic intermarriages. However, the practice also caused difficulties and challenges, particularly for women.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was met with opposition and persecution, particularly after the U.S. government passed laws against it in 1862. Latter-day Saints engaged in civil disobedience by continuing to practice plural marriage and attempting to avoid arrest. The Church's temples were threatened with seizure by the U.S. government, leading to the issuance of the Manifesto by Church President Wilford Woodruff in 1890, which declared the Church's intention to submit to the laws of the United States and largely ended the practice of plural marriage in the Church.\n\nDespite the challenges and difficulties associated with plural marriage, many Latter-day Saints saw", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

In contrast, higher-skilled players were more positive towards female teammates.\n\nThe researchers argue that this behavior can be explained through an evolutionary perspective, suggesting that lower-status males may use aggression to maintain their social rank and access to potential mates, especially when faced with a hierarchical reorganization due to the entry of a woman into the competitive arena. Higher-skilled players, who have less to lose from such reorganization, behave more positively in an attempt to support and garner attention from the female player.\n\nThese findings provide insights into the factors that affect male hostility towards women, highlighting the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the causes of sexism. The studies also suggest that teaching young males that losing to the opposite sex is not socially debilitating could potentially help counteract sexist behavior.\n\nThe studies were conducted in online environments where players are anonymous, policing individual behavior is difficult, and the sex ratio is heavily skewed towards men, making these findings relevant to other online spaces such as Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan. Interestingly, women are more vulnerable to sexual harassment and stalking in these environments, according to a recent Pew report.\n\nThe studies were published in the journals PLOS One and PLoS ONE, with the Halo 3 study receiving particular attention for its unique use of a video game to probe human behavior.

Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The use of e-cigarettes has been associated with an increase in the number of teenagers using nicotine, either through e-cigarettes or traditional tobacco products.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Pediatrics, researchers from the University of Southern California (USC) found that the number of high school seniors in Southern California who smoked or vaped in the past 30 days increased from 9% in 2004 to 14% in 2014. This suggests that e-cigarettes are not replacing traditional cigarette use among teenagers but are instead attracting a new group of users who would not have used tobacco products otherwise.\n\nAnother study found that adolescents who reported e-cigarette use had more than six times the odds of initiating cigarette use as never e-cigarette users. This study also found that the risk of initiating any combustible tobacco product, including hookah, cigars, or pipes, was also increased among e-cigarette users.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans annually. The concern is that e-cigarettes may serve as a gateway to traditional cigarette use, particularly among teenagers who have never smoked before.\n\nE-cigarettes work by heating a liquid containing nicotine and other substances to produce an aerosol that is inhaled. They are perceived as less harmful than traditional cigarettes, but the long-term risks and effects of e-cigarettes are not yet known. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced plans to regulate all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, but regulations have not yet been implemented.\n\nCalifornia has become the second state, after Hawaii, to raise the age of tobacco purchase, including e-cigarettes, from 18 to 21.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014).

This hemispheric specialization, where the left brain is better at processing fast sounds and the right processing slow ones, is known as asymmetrical sound processing. This finding challenges the notion that only humans use such brain asymmetry for sound processing, as no other animal, including monkeys and apes, has shown this specialization. The study, published in Frontiers of Neuroscience, suggests that this asymmetry in both human and bat brains may have evolved to help humans identify speakers, gauge emotional states, and coordinate activities within groups, while bats use it to communicate effectively with each other by distinguishing their communication sounds, which have rapid changes in frequency.\n\nThe study's senior author, Stuart Washington from Georgetown, explains that the need for this asymmetry is more compelling in bats, as they need to use the fast timing of the left hemisphere to distinguish communication sounds and the slow timing of the right hemisphere to use sonar for detecting insects. The study also found that this asymmetric sound processing is sex-dependent in bats, with males showing more asymmetry than females, which is consistent with the human pattern.\n\nThe researchers believe that the downside of having such asymmetrical sound processing is that it makes in-depth scientific studies of certain communication disorders, such as aphasia, challenging due to the need for methods that can only be permitted in animals.

The second passage discusses the growing trend of young, single women becoming new mothers, with more than half of American women under 30 giving birth outside of marriage. This trend is highlighted in a New York Times article.\n\nThe third news passage provides an in-depth look at Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), a group of conditions that can occur in a child when the mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy. The condition can cause physical, behavioral, and cognitive problems, and there is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy. The fourth news passage discusses the negative effects of alcohol during pregnancy, including the potential for FASD, and the importance of avoiding alcohol during pregnancy to prevent these issues.\n\nThe fifth news passage focuses on Polizzi's history of drinking and partying, as she has built her fame on her antics on \"Jersey Shore,\" which often involved skipping work, flashing her panties, getting arrested, and drinking heavily. The passage questions whether Polizzi's troubles, should she be pregnant, are different from those of other young, single women.\n\nThe sixth news passage discusses Polizzi's interview with Ellen DeGeneres, where she admits to over-indulging in alcohol.

{"pred": "The mystery surrounding the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has been a topic of interest for years. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that Craig Steven Wright, an Australian entrepreneur and computer expert, may be the creator of Bitcoin. Wright, who has a background in law, statistics, and research, has been linked to Bitcoin through blog posts, emails, and leaked documents that show a clear connection to the creation of Bitcoin. The strongest evidence includes an August 2008 blog post mentioning a \"cryptocurrency paper\" and references to \"triple entry accounting,\" a financial cryptography concept that outlines several Bitcoin-like ideas. Additionally, a post from November 2008 includes a request for readers to encrypt messages to Wright using a PGP public key associated with the email address satoshin@vistomail.com, which is similar to the email address used by Nakamoto to introduce Bitcoin to a cryptography mailing list.\n\nFurther evidence includes a leaked email from Wright to his lawyer in June 2008 discussing a \"P2P distributed ledger\" and a reference to a paper called \"Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party\" that Wright expected to release in 2009. Another leaked email from Wright to computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, just before Bitcoin's launch in January 2009, discusses a paper they had been working on together and Wright's plans to take a buyout from his job to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nThe most intriguing piece of evidence is a leaked PDF authored by Kleiman, signed with a PGP signature, that agrees to take control of a trust fund containing 1.1 million bitcoins, the same size as a mysterious Bitcoin fortune that has long been attributed to Nakamoto. This fortune, which has never moved on the Bitcoin blockchain, could hold the key to understanding why it has never been spent.\n\nWright's connection to Bitcoin has been a closely guarded secret, and he has demonstrated a talent for obfuscation and a love of privacy. However, in December 2015, WIRED sent an encrypted email to Wright suggesting they knew his secret and asking for a meeting. Wright responded with a wary message, but later gave a revealing answer when WIRED described the three blog posts that showed his clear connection to Bitcoin", "answers": ["Wired says it has uncovered \"the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity.\" Nakamoto, the alias for the creator of Bitcoin, has never been unmasked publicly, but Wired's Andy Greenberg and Gwern Branwen name Australian Craig Wright, 44, as the most likely candidate. \"Either Wright invented Bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer,\" they write. Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright—founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo—blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $60 million in Bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million Bitcoins worth $605 million—the same amount attributed to Nakamoto. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" Wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day Newsweek claimed American Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's inventor.

Hurricane Harvey: The news reports detail the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which brought unprecedented rainfall and flooding to Houston, causing widespread destruction and displacement. The storm has been described as a test for the nation's ability to coalesce as a community and forge common ground, given the current political climate. The response to the storm has raised questions about the cost of recovery and the role of climate change in intensifying such disasters.\n\n2. Funding fights and political division: The news highlights the history of partisan conflicts over funding for disaster recovery, citing examples from Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. The debate over funding has been marked by demands for offsetting cuts in other programs, which is seen as undermining the idea of government's role in sharing risks that individuals and communities cannot reasonably bear alone.\n\n3. Climate change and Hurricane Harvey: The news reports discuss the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of disasters like Hurricane Harvey. Scientists agree that warmer air and water can lead to wetter and more intense hurricanes. The storm's severity has been attributed to warmer ocean temperatures, which provide more energy for hurricanes, and warmer air, which can hold more moisture. There is ongoing debate about whether climate change played a role in Harvey's stalling over Texas, which contributed to the catastrophic flooding.\n\n4. Climate change and journalism: Some news reports criticize the media for failing to discuss the role of climate change in disasters like Hurricane Harvey, arguing that this omission is a political decision that ignores the facts and context. The media is accused of prioritizing politics over truth, leaving the public with a false impression that disasters have no root causes and that nothing can be done to prevent them.\n\n5. Climate change and systemic injustices: Other news reports emphasize the need to discuss climate change, systemic injustices, and other root causes of disasters like Hurricane Harvey. These discussions include the links between climate disruption and migration, the need for an immigration policy that acknowledges the U.S.'s role", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The coup attempt resulted in over 250 deaths and more than 1,400 injuries.\n\nThe coup attempt was initially successful in seizing control of several key institutions, including the military headquarters in Ankara and the Turkish parliament, but was eventually quashed by government forces.

Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA.

But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

The BCI system allows patients to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" by regulating their frontocentral brain regions in response to auditorily presented questions. The study involved four ALS patients in CLIS, and the BCI was employed successfully for training patients to regulate their brain activity over several days. The fNIRS-based BCI was found to be more effective than neuroelectrical signals like electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) for communication. The study's results suggest that this technology could potentially abolish complete paralysis in ALS patients, at least for those in CLIS.\n\nThe study was funded by various grants, including the German Ministry of Education and Research, the Stiftung Volkswagenwerk, and the European Union.

The study also found that the performance of the BCI was affected by low-frequency brain waves, with lower frequencies associated with poorer performance.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

The EPA, State Department, and Agriculture Department are among the hardest hit, with proposed cuts of more than 30%, 28%, and 21% respectively. The budget also proposes eliminating federal support for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The cuts could represent the widest swath of reductions in federal programs since the drawdown after World War II, potentially leading to a significant cutback in the federal non-military workforce.\n\nThe budget proposal faces stiff resistance from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, with many expressing skepticism about the proposed cuts, particularly in foreign aid and diplomacy. The administration's budget must be approved by Congress, and it is expected that many of the proposed cuts will be revised or rejected. The budget does not address taxes, Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, and a more comprehensive budget plan is expected to be released in May.\n\nThe budget also includes a $1.15 trillion proposal for the Department of Defense, promising immediate money for troop readiness, the fight against Islamic State militants, and procurement of new ships, fighter jets, and other weapons.

The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday. He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,\" Sen.

Pistorius claimed he mistook Steenkamp for a burglar and shot her through a locked bathroom door. However, doubts about Pistorius's character have arisen, with reports suggesting he was an aggressive, entitled, and reckless individual who surrounded himself with violent associates. Hilton Botha, the initial investigating detective, has provided inconsistent testimony and has since been removed from the case due to his own legal troubles.

Pistorius in particular comes off as an egomaniac with long-standing anger issues. \"When Pistorius competed at the London Olympics, last summer, (a radio host) interviewed the athlete’s roommate at the Olympic Village: ‘What is it like to sleep in the same room with a superstar?’ And he said, ‘I moved out. Oscar is always shouting at people on the phone.’\" A \"former confidant\" tells Seal that the Olympics changed Pistorius for the worse. “He was bragging about his adventures in the good life. He was like, ‘I’m the man, I’m Oscar. The world owes me.’ That sense of entitlement. He wasn’t like that; he was made into that.\" In subsequent training sessions at a gym, his “swearing would astonish the mothers and children also using the gym,\" says a reporter. “He would storm out of the gym midway through a workout. He would be surly, rude.

Some of the women have come forward publicly, including Joan Tarshis, Victoria Valentino, and Barbara Bowman, while others have chosen to remain anonymous.\n\nThe allegations have led to the cancellation of Cosby's scheduled appearance on David Letterman's show, as well as the cancellation of several other upcoming projects and performances. Cosby's latest visit to the Late Show with David Letterman was cancelled due to the allegations, and it was revealed that Cosby had made strange backstage requests in the past, including asking female staffers to watch him eat curry before his appearances.\n\nCosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has issued statements denying the allegations and attacking the credibility of the accusers.

The new name honors solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The mission, scheduled for launch in July 2018, will be the first to explore the sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, and will travel closer to the sun than any other spacecraft in history. The probe will have to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation to perform its tasks, such as measuring the sun's electric and magnetic fields, studying the solar wind, and understanding the heating of the solar corona. The mission aims to answer long-standing questions about the sun and its impact on Earth, including the potential for solar storms to cause damage to satellites, power supplies, and other technology. The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with pictures of Parker and his seminal paper, as well as an inscription chosen by Parker himself. The mission is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its role in the solar system. This is the first time a NASA spacecraft has been named for a living individual.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}
