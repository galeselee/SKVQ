{"pred": "The report discusses the complexities and risks associated with the global information technology (IT) supply chains used by federal agencies. The report highlights the challenges in understanding the sources of an information system due to the intricate corporate structures and the involvement of multiple countries in the supply chain. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires federal agencies to manage information security risks throughout the life cycle of each system, and NIST has issued guidelines to help agencies address supply chain risks.\n\nThe report identifies several potential risks associated with the global IT supply chain, including the installation of malicious logic, counterfeit hardware or software, disruptions in the production or distribution of critical products, reliance on unqualified service providers, installation of unintentional vulnerabilities, and failures in acquisition or security procedures. These risks can lead to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and associated information, which can adversely affect an agency's ability to carry out its mission.\n\nThe report notes that while the four national security-related agencies (Defense, Justice, Energy, and DHS) have acknowledged the risks presented by supply chain vulnerabilities, their progress in addressing these risks varies. The Department of Defense has made significant progress in addressing supply chain risks, while the other three agencies have made limited progress.\n\nThe report makes several recommendations to help the agencies better address IT supply chain-related security risks, including developing and documenting departmental policies and procedures, and implementing monitoring capabilities to verify compliance and assess the effectiveness of supply chain protection measures. The agencies generally agreed with the recommendations, and most of them have implemented the suggested measures. However, as of fiscal year 2016, DHS had not fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability.\n\nThe report concludes that the global IT supply chain introduces a myriad of security risks to federal information systems, and federal agencies must appropriately assess, manage, and monitor IT supply chain risks as part of their agency-wide information security programs. The report also notes that the efforts of the four national security-related agencies to address supply chain security can benefit all federal agencies in addressing their IT supply chain risks.", "answers": ["IT systems are essential to the operations of the federal government. The supply chain—the set of organizations, people, activities, and resources that create and move a product from suppliers to end users—for IT systems is complex and global in scope. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IT supply chain is a continuing threat. Federal security guidelines provide for managing the risks to the supply chain. This testimony statement highlights information security risks associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT systems. The statement also summarizes GAO's 2012 report that assessed the extent to which four national security-related agencies had addressed such risks. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previous reports, as well as information provided by the national security-related agencies on their actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations. GAO also reviewed federal information security guidelines and directives. Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal information systems. Supply chain threats are present during the various phases of an information system's development life cycle and could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies. Information technology (IT) supply chain-related threats are varied and can include: installation of intentionally harmful hardware or software (i.e., containing “malicious logic”); installation of counterfeit hardware or software; failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products; reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers for the performance of technical services; and installation of hardware or software containing unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defective code. These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of materials needed to develop systems. These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include the acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; inadequate testing of software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain. GAO reported in 2012 that the four national security-related agencies in its review—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. Of the four agencies, Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. It had defined and implemented supply chain protection controls, and initiated efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Conversely, Energy and DHS had not developed or documented policies and procedures that defined security measures for protecting against IT supply chain threats and had not developed capabilities for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. Although Justice had defined supply chain protection measures, it also had not developed or documented procedures for implementing or monitoring the measures. Energy and Justice fully implemented the recommendations that GAO made in its 2012 report and resolved the deficiencies that GAO had identified with their supply chain risk management efforts by 2016. DHS also fully implemented two recommendations to document policies and procedures for defining and implementing security measures to protect against supply chain threats by 2015, but could not demonstrate that it had fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to assess the effectiveness of the security measures. In its 2012 report, GAO recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The departments generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3092}

In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring. GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption. GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites. All three agencies require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions.

{"pred": "The report, prepared by a government agency, provides an analysis of the seizures made by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from 2012 to 2016. During this period, CBP conducted approximately 308,000 seizures of items that posed a threat to U.S. security, health, safety, business, and ecology. The majority of these seizures, about 70%, were from mail, while the remaining 30% were from express cargo. The seized items were categorized as either drugs or merchandise, with illegal or inadmissible drugs accounting for about 47% of total seizures and merchandise accounting for about 53%.\n\nThe report also highlights the increase in fentanyl-related deaths and the subsequent focus on identifying methods for fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. While CBP's seizure data showed no fentanyl seizures from 2012 to 2015, a specific category for fentanyl was added to the Seized Asset and Case Tracking System (SEACATS) in 2016, reflecting 53 seizures via mail and express cargo in that year.\n\nThe report further discusses the challenges faced by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in providing EAD (Electronic Advance Data) for inbound international mail, which is crucial for CBP to target mail for inspection. USPS only provided EAD for about one-third of all inbound international mail (excluding letters, flats, and military/diplomatic mail) for the period from April 2016 to March 2017, and for roughly half of all inbound international mail for the month of March 2017.\n\nTwo pilot programs were initiated in 2014 and 2015 at the New York International Service Center to test the effectiveness of placing holds on mail that has been targeted for inspection based on EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. However, the report notes that USPS and CBP lack clear performance goals for these pilots and have not conducted an analysis to determine if they are achieving the desired outcomes.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes information contained in GAO's August 2017 report, entitled International Mail Security: Costs and Benefits of Using Electronic Data to Screen Mail Need to Be Assessed ( GAO-17-606 ). U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary federal agency tasked with targeting and inspecting inbound international items and seizing illegal goods, including illegal or inadmissible drugs and merchandise. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and express consignment operators (such as FedEx and DHL) provide items to CBP for inspection. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with electronic advance data (EAD), such as the shipper's and recipient's name and address, for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement. In 2014 and 2015, USPS and CBP initiated two pilot programs at the New York International Service Center (ISC) to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. Under the pilots, CBP uses EAD to target a small number of pieces of mail each day. According to USPS officials, when USPS employees scan either individual targeted pieces or larger sacks containing this targeted mail, they are alerted that CBP has targeted the item and set the item or sack aside for inspection. According to USPS and CBP, USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection because locating targeted mail once it arrives at an ISC has been a challenge. Since the pilots began, USPS has provided CBP with about 82 percent of targeted mail for one pilot, and about 58 percent of targeted mail for the other. However, while USPS and CBP have collected some performance information for these pilots (including the percentage of targeted mail provided for inspection), this information is not linked to a specific performance target agreed upon by USPS and CBP--such as a specific percentage of targeted mail provided to CBP for inspection. Further, the agencies have not conducted an analysis to determine if the pilot programs are achieving desired outcomes. Because CBP and USPS lack clear performance goals for these pilots, they risk spending additional time and resources expanding them prior to fully assessing the pilots' success or failure. In our report we found that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing time and resources needed for the screening process--potentially decreasing costs--and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. For example, CBP has collected data on the percentage of inspections resulting in a seizure for mail inspected as a result of targeting in the pilot programs at the New York ISC. However, CBP does not collect comparable data for seizures resulting from inspections conducted based on current methods of choosing mail for inspection. In light of the challenges that collecting and using these data present, it is important that CBP and USPS carefully consider actions to enhance inbound international mail security to avoid wasting time and money on potentially ineffective and costly endeavors. In our report, we recommended that CBP, in coordination with USPS: (1) establish measureable performance goals to assess pilot programs and (2) evaluate the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection compared with other targeting methods. CBP and USPS agreed with these recommendations and CBP plans to implement them by February 28, 2018."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2565}

{"pred": "The report discusses the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program, a joint federal-state program financed by payroll taxes, aimed at providing financial assistance to unemployed workers during economic fluctuations such as recessions. The UC program's funding and benefit structure are designed to counteract economic fluctuations, with increased tax revenues during economic growth and decreased spending on benefits when fewer workers are unemployed. This cyclical pattern creates a reserve fund for the UC program to draw upon during recessions.\n\nStates levy their own payroll taxes (SUTA) to fund regular UC benefits and the state share of the Extended Benefit (EB) program. When the economy is robust, SUTA revenue is typically greater than a state's UC expenditures, leading to a growth in the state's reserves within the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). During recessions and economic slowdowns, these reserves are drawn down, and new SUTA revenue may not be sufficient to cover the shortfall. If a state's reserves are insufficient to pay for UC benefits, it may opt to borrow from the federal loan account within the UTF, with the obligation to repay the loans, including any interest due.\n\nFederal unemployment taxes, collected under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), pay for the federal share of EB and for administrative grants to the states.

The report highlights that FCC has not conducted program evaluations as planned, despite calling for them in the past. For instance, a review of the administration of universal service programs, including Lifeline, was supposed to be completed by 1999 but was never done. Similarly, a study on the administration of the Universal Service Fund (USF) programs, which includes Lifeline, was contracted to the National Academy of Public Administration in 2005 but was terminated by the FCC.\n\nIn March 2015, the FCC was recommended to conduct a program evaluation to determine the effectiveness of Lifeline in achieving its goals, but this evaluation has not been completed. The report raises concerns about the accuracy of the data provided by the FCC regarding Lifeline enrollment, as it is unclear how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline benefits also have non-Lifeline phone services. Without this information, it is difficult for the FCC to determine whether it is achieving its goal of increasing telephone subscribership among low-income consumers while minimizing the USF contribution burden.\n\nThe report also notes that the FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption, but broadband adoption rates have increased for low-income populations without a Lifeline subsidy. The report found that some providers offer low-income broadband service for less than $10 per month, which is less expensive than the FCC's broadband reasonable-comparability cost benchmark of approximately $55 per month.\n\nThe report recommends that the FCC take steps to address weaknesses in the program, including requiring Commissioners to review and approve spending above the budget, reviewing customer bills for transparency, and addressing pending requests concerning USF contribution requirements. The report also recommends that the FCC move USF funds from a private bank to the Treasury to improve oversight and accountability.\n\nThe report also highlights weaknesses in the eligibility verification process, as Lifeline providers are responsible for verifying the eligibility of applicants, but lack of access to state eligibility", "answers": ["Created in the mid-1980s, FCC's Lifeline program provides discounts to eligible low-income households for home or wireless telephone and, as of December 2016, broadband service.

This testimony is based on GAO's May 2017 report and discusses steps FCC has taken to measure Lifeline's performance in meeting goals; steps FCC and USAC have taken to enhance controls over finances, subscribers, and providers; and any weaknesses that might remain. For the May 2017 report, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from FCC and USAC. GAO also analyzed subscriber data from 2014 and performed undercover tests to identify potential improper payment vulnerabilities. The results of this analysis and testing are illustrative, not generalizable. In its May 2017 report, GAO found the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated the Lifeline program's (Lifeline) performance in meeting its goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income households by providing financial support, but it has recently taken steps to begin to do so. FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized.

In its May 2017 report GAO found the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated the Lifeline program's (Lifeline) performance in meeting its goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income households by providing financial support, but it has recently taken steps to begin to do so. FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. In its May 2017 report, GAO made seven recommendations, including that FCC ensure plans to transfer the USF from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented expeditiously. FCC generally agreed with all the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3955}
{"pred": "This report examines the use of tax incentives by the U.S. government to promote energy policy objectives since the 1970s. The report's primary focus is on tax incentives that support the production or investment in various energy resources. Historically, the majority of revenue losses associated with energy tax incentives were from provisions benefiting fossil fuels. However, since the mid-2000s, the balance has shifted, with the bulk of federal revenue losses now coming from incentives for renewable energy production and investment.\n\nIn 2017, 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production was from fossil fuels, with natural gas, crude oil, and coal being the largest contributors. Renewable energy sources accounted for 12.8% of primary energy production, with biomass being the largest renewable energy source. The report notes that the analysis does not account for federal spending on energy that is not linked to the tax code.\n\nThe report also provides an analysis of the value of tax incentives relative to energy production for both fossil fuels and renewable energy resources. In 2017, 25.8% of the value of energy-related tax incentives went toward supporting fossil fuels, while 65.2% went toward supporting renewables. However, it is important to note that this analysis has limitations, as it does not account for interaction effects, differences in policy rationales, or the timing of tax incentives relative to energy production.\n\nThe report concludes by highlighting that the balance of energy tax incentives is shifting, with revenue losses associated with fossil fuels expected to increase over the next decade, while those for renewables are projected to decline as certain provisions phase down or expire. The report emphasizes that the amount of tax-related support for the energy sector could decline if provisions are allowed to expire as scheduled under current law. The report serves as a useful resource for policymakers evaluating the current status of energy tax policy, but further analysis is needed to determine the economic efficiency and effectiveness of the current system of energy tax incentives.", "answers": ["The U.S. tax code supports the energy sector by providing a number of targeted tax incentives, or tax incentives available only for the energy industry. Some policymakers have expressed interest in understanding how energy tax benefits are distributed across different domestic energy resources. For example, what percentage of energy-related tax benefits support fossil fuels (or support renewables)? How much domestic energy is produced using fossil fuels (or produced using renewables)? And how do these figures compare? In 2017, the value of federal tax-related support for the energy sector was estimated to be $17.8 billion. Of this, $4.6 billion (25.8%) can be attributed to tax incentives supporting fossil fuels. Tax-related support for renewables was an estimated $11.6 billion in 2017 (or 65.2% of total tax-related support for energy). The remaining tax-related support went toward nuclear energy, efficiency measures, and alternative technology vehicles. While the cost of tax incentives for renewables has exceeded the cost of incentives for fossil fuels in recent years, the majority of energy produced in the United States continues to be derived from fossil fuels. In 2017, fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production. The remaining primary energy production is attributable to renewable energy and nuclear electric resources, with shares of 12.8% and 9.5%, respectively. The balance of energy-related tax incentives has changed over time, and it is projected to continue to change, under current law, in coming years. Factors that have contributed to recent changes in the balance of energy-related tax incentives include the following: Increased tax expenditures for solar and wind. Tax expenditures associated with the energy credit for solar and the production tax credit for wind have increased substantially in recent years. Following the long-term extensions of these temporary tax benefits provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), tax expenditures for the solar energy credit are projected to remain stable for several years, before decreasing in the longer term. The expiration of tax-related support for renewable fuels. Tax-related support for renewable fuels declined substantially after the tax credits for alcohol fuels were allowed to expire at the end of 2011. Other fuels-related incentives also expired at the end of 2017 (although these may be extended as part of the \"tax extenders\"). Decline then increase in tax expenditures for fossil fuels. Tax expenditures for fossil fuels declined between 2017 and 2018, an indirect effect of the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97). Over time, however, the tax expenditures associated with permanent fossil fuels tax incentives are estimated to increase. One starting point for evaluating energy tax policy may be a calculation of subsidy relative to production level. However, a complete policy analysis might consider why the level of federal financial support differs across various energy technologies. Tax incentives for energy may support various environmental or economic objectives. For example, tax incentives designed to reduce reliance on imported petroleum may be consistent with energy security goals. Tax incentives that promote renewable energy resources may be consistent with certain environmental objectives."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3582}
{"pred": "The DEA, under the Department of Justice, regulates the handling and disposal of controlled substances to prevent diversion and abuse. The Controlled Substances Act requires entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances to register with DEA. The Disposal Act of 2010 allows the public to dispose of unused controlled substances at authorized entities, with DEA responsible for setting regulations to prevent diversion while considering public health, cost, and implementation. The regulations outline three methods for disposal: disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Law enforcement agencies can use all three methods without authorization. Eligible entities, such as pharmacies and hospitals, can become authorized collectors by modifying their DEA registration, a process that is free and simple. As of April 2017, 2.49% of eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors, with most being pharmacies or hospitals. However, participation rates vary significantly by state, with North Dakota having the highest and many states having less than 5% participation. The report suggests that costs, uncertainty over regulations, and participation in other disposal efforts may be factors affecting participation rates. The report also notes that as of April 2017, about half of the U.S. population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin, with urban areas having more access than rural areas. The report recommends that DEA address cost issues, provide clearer guidance on regulations, and consider resolving conflicts with other federal regulations to increase participation rates.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3373}

DHS is required to decrease the number of permits issued annually, reducing them to zero by the end of the transition period, scheduled for December 31, 2019. To implement the law, DHS established a new work permit program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers can obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI. The law was amended in August 2017 to, among other things, restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations.

The Department of Defense (DOD) may use LPTA procedures when the requirement is clearly defined, the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, and additional performance beyond the minimum technical requirements would not provide any value. In such cases, DOD specifies its minimum requirements in the solicitation, and firms submit proposals based on these requirements. The award is given to the lowest-priced proposal that meets or exceeds the government's requirements. Non-cost factors are rated as either acceptable or unacceptable, and no tradeoffs between price or cost and non-cost factors are allowed.\n\nOn the other hand, DOD may use tradeoff procedures in acquisitions where the requirement is less definitive, more development work is required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these instances, non-cost factors may play a dominant role in the source selection process, and tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors are allowed.\n\nThe report also highlights the DOD's increased use of LPTA procedures for new contracts, particularly for commercial products or services and situations where there would be no value in a product or service exceeding the solicitation’s minimum technical requirements. However, the report notes that DOD rarely uses LPTA procedures for IT and support services contracts valued at $10 million or more.\n\nThe report also discusses a 2017 revision to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) that requires LPTA procedures to be used only when six specific criteria are met.

In contrast, DOD may use the trade-off source selection process to award a higher-priced contract to a firm if the firm's offer provides greater benefit and it is worth paying the additional cost. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 calls on DOD to avoid using the LPTA process for information technology, cybersecurity, and other knowledge-based professional support services. The Act also included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's use of LPTA procedures for contracts valued at more than $10 million. This report assesses the (1) extent to which DOD used LPTA procedures for certain services, and (2) factors that contracting officials considered when deciding to use LPTA procedures. GAO reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation to identify 781 contracts valued at $10 million or above awarded by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the first half of fiscal year 2017, the most recent period for which data were available. GAO then selected 133 of these contracts for information technology and support services, which include services reflected in the Act. GAO identified that 9 contracts used LPTA procedures and reviewed 7 of these, including interviewing officials and reviewing contract documents. DOD had no comments on the draft report. During the first half of fiscal year 2017, the Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures when awarding contracts valued at $10 million or more for the types of services identified by the National Defense Authorization Act, such as information technology services. Department of Defense (DOD) guidance states that LPTA procedures are typically for requirements that are well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services with a minimal risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The figure shows the military departments' limited use of LPTA procedures for contracts for selected services. For the 7 contracts that GAO reviewed, contracting officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. Contracting officials also stated that LPTA was used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For example, the Navy used LPTA procedures to award a contract for commercially available monthly telephone maintenance services. In addition, the Air Force used LPTA procedures to award a contract for mail sorting and delivery. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to amend its regulations to require contracting officers to consider specific criteria when deciding to use LPTA procedures. DOD has not yet revised its regulations to implement Section 813.

This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out under the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol. Ninety-nine concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Rotunda between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. Use of the Capitol Grounds can be authorized either by the passage of a concurrent resolution or through an application process with the Capitol Police. A concurrent resolution is typically needed for events longer than 24 hours in duration, for events that require vehicles on the Capitol Grounds for setup, for events requiring electronics on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, and for events where a large number of Members will be in attendance. The Capitol Police's special events office handles permits and approval for all other events.

Rebalancing to the Pacific became strategic guidance that informed military planning. By the end of 2015, DOD published strategy documents that included references to the rebalance to the Pacific or related concepts. In February 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs stated that while DOD continues to prioritize the Asia-Pacific region, the rebalance to the Pacific is no longer U.S. policy. DOD has published the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which establishes an objective of maintaining a favorable regional balance in the Pacific region, among other regions. Prior to the change in policy, House Report 114-102 included a provision for GAO to review matters related to the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that included desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO analyzed six DOD strategy documents that officials identified as providing guidance for the rebalance to the Pacific to determine whether, as a set, they included desired elements associated with an effective national strategy. DOD had no comments on this report. Department of Defense (DOD) strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. The U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), which is responsible for the Asia-Pacific region, used DOD strategy documents to implement the President's direction to rebalance to the Pacific, which generally refocused U.S. efforts to that region. PACOM officials told GAO that there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense ; Quadrennial Defense Review ; National Military Strategy ; Guidance for the Employment of the Force ; Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan ; and the PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) . Based on GAO's analysis, DOD's six strategy documents that guided the rebalance to the Pacific included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective national strategy. However, two key elements were missing from the group of strategy documents: (1) a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific, and (2) the identification of the overall results desired, or end state, for the rebalance. DOD officials also could not identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents or provide a definition that was used consistently across the department. According to a DOD official with performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative's strategic objectives, or end state, were important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a clear definition of rebalance could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance from activities that were peripheral to that effort. Similarly, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress, and facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives.

IAO identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require authentication and categorized them based on potential risks. In 2016, IAO released a Roadmap for developing a secure authentication environment for all taxpayers.\n\nThe report praises the collaboration between IRS, industry members, and state partners through the Security Summit, an ongoing effort to improve information sharing, fraud detection, and address common identity theft challenges. The Authentication Workgroup within the Security Summit is working on initiatives to verify the authenticity of taxpayers and their returns during the filing process.\n\nHowever, the report also points out that IRS has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, which is inconsistent with program management leading practices. For instance, one of the foundational initiatives is to send event-driven notifications to taxpayers, which could help detect fraudulent activity at an early stage. However, the Roadmap notes that seven supporting activities will take between 6 months to 3 years to complete, and IRS has not identified the resources required for these activities.\n\nThe report also recommends that IRS implement the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) June 2017 guidance for secure online authentication, establish detailed plans for implementation, and develop a plan with timelines, milestone dates, and resources needed. Additionally, IRS lacks a comprehensive, repeatable process to identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and approaches. The report suggests several authentication options for IRS to consider, including possession-based authentication, working with trusted partners, and expanding the functionality of its online account to further protect taxpayers.\n\nIn conclusion, the report emphasizes the importance of IRS strengthening its authentication systems to stay ahead of fraudsters' schemes and protect taxpayers' personal information.

IRS authenticates millions of taxpayers each year via telephone, online, in person, and correspondence to ensure that it is interacting with legitimate taxpayers. IRS's estimated costs to authenticate taxpayers vary by channel. IRS has made progress on monitoring and improving authentication, including developing an authentication strategy with high-level strategic efforts. However, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. Doing so would help IRS clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits. Further, while IRS regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications, it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence channels, including mechanisms to collect reliable, useful data to monitor authentication outcomes. As a result, IRS may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system. IRS can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters.

These missions are managed through six mission programs and are carried out by a multimission fleet of aircraft, ships, and boats. The Coast Guard has established goals and targets for each mission to assess performance and communicate agency progress. Some targets are derived from external factors, such as the requirement to save 100% of people in imminent danger in the maritime environment. The Coast Guard is modernizing its assets to improve mission capabilities, with ongoing acquisitions such as the National Security Cutter and Fast Response Cutter. However, concerns remain about the affordability of these acquisitions due to a lack of long-term planning.\n\nThe report highlights several areas where the Coast Guard could improve its data management for more effective program management. Recommendations include improving the completeness of mission data, using more realistic asset performance data, improving performance goal data, and increasing transparency of data on mission performance and capital planning. Specifically, the Coast Guard should ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured, work with stakeholders to establish a reliable estimate of the active commercial fishing vessel population, incorporate field unit input for more realistic asset allocation decisions, and assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations.\n\nThe Coast Guard has agreed with these recommendations and is in the process of implementing them. The report also recommends that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report be made publicly available on its website to provide full visibility over performance across all of its missions. The Coast Guard is also encouraged to develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan to better understand the affordability challenges it faces and make informed tradeoff decisions across its acquisition portfolio.

This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan.

The report highlights the importance of a skilled and capable cybersecurity workforce in achieving this goal, particularly within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which leads the federal government's efforts in this area.\n\nThe report notes that the federal government, including DHS, faces a persistent shortage of cybersecurity and IT talent, which could leave federal IT systems vulnerable to malicious attacks. The report identifies several challenges that federal agencies, including DHS, face in ensuring they have a sufficient cybersecurity workforce with the necessary skills to protect their information and networks from cyber threats. These challenges include identifying and closing skill gaps, recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and navigating the federal hiring process.\n\nTo address these challenges, the report discusses various initiatives that the federal government has taken to improve the cybersecurity workforce. These include the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), which promotes cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development, and the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, which provides a consistent way to define and describe cybersecurity work roles and tasks.\n\nThe report also discusses DHS's efforts to identify and code its cybersecurity positions in accordance with the 2014 Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act. The report finds that DHS has not yet fully implemented the procedures required by the act, including the identification and coding of vacant positions, and has not assigned employment codes to all its identified cybersecurity positions as required. The report makes several recommendations to DHS to address these issues, including developing procedures for identifying vacant positions, assigning responsibility for leading and overseeing the identification and coding of cybersecurity positions, and establishing a process for reviewing component procedures.\n\nIn conclusion, the report emphasizes the importance of a skilled and capable cybersecurity workforce in securing the nation's critical infrastructure and highlights the need for DHS to fully implement the procedures required by the 2014 Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act to ensure that it has the necessary personnel to carry out its critical role in protecting the nation's cyberspace.", "answers": ["DHS is the lead agency tasked with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to all of the department's cybersecurity workforce positions.

Further, the act required DHS to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce critical needs. GAO was asked to testify on the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. To do so, GAO summarized the findings discussed in its February 2018 report on DHS's cybersecurity workforce ( GAO-18-175 ). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 ; however, its actions have not been timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS did not complete efforts to identify all of the department's cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. In August 2017, DHS reported to Congress that it had coded 95 percent of the department's identified cybersecurity positions. However, the department had, at that time, coded approximately 79 percent of the positions. DHS's 95 percent estimate was overstated primarily because it excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions. In addition, although DHS has taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it has not identified or reported to Congress on its departmentwide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also has not reported annually its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required, and has not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. (See table). Without ensuring that its procedures are complete and that its progress in identifying and assigning codes to its cybersecurity positions is accurately reported, DHS will not be positioned to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning. Further, until DHS establishes plans and time frames for reporting on its critical needs, the department may not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department's and the nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The commitment of DHS's leadership to addressing these matters is essential to helping the department fulfill the act's requirements. In its February 2018 report, GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed.

Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018. FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including USDA, unfinished. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2019 (H.R. 5961, S. 2976), with the Senate having amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus (H.R. 6147). Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018, at the FY2018 level (P.L. 115-245). After December 21, 2018, a partial shutdown of the government, including many agencies within USDA, occurred. One of the few exceptions was the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown.

The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on February 15, 2019, funding USDA through the end of the fiscal year (Division B, P.L. 116-6). Agricultural conservation programs include both mandatory and discretionary spending. Most conservation program funding is mandatory and is authorized in omnibus farm bills. Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary and are funded through annual appropriations. The largest discretionary program is the Conservation Operations (CO) account, which funds conservation planning and implementation assistance on private agricultural lands across the country. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million for CO, an increase from the FY2017 enacted amount ($864 million). The enacted FY2019 appropriation decreases funding for CO below FY2018 levels to $819 million and redirects funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. Other discretionary spending is primarily for watershed programs. The largest—Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO)—was funded at $150 million annually in FY2018 and FY2019. Most mandatory conservation programs are authorized in omnibus farm bills and do not require an annual appropriation. However, Congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) in the annual agricultural appropriations law every year since FY2003. The enacted FY2018 omnibus marks the first appropriation since FY2002 that did not include CHIMPS to mandatory conservation programs. The enacted FY2019 appropriation also does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs, as most programs' authorizations expired on September 30, 2018, making these programs ineligible for reduction. The 2018 farm bill (Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs. While this is infrequent, the Agriculture appropriations bill may also serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act included two such amendments—one to WFPO and one to farm bill conservation program reporting requirements. The WFPO amendment increased the size threshold required for congressional approval. Under the amended language, the Senate and House Agriculture Committees must approve WFPO projects that include an estimated federal contribution of more than $25 million for construction, an increase from the previous $5 million threshold. Additionally, the FY2018 appropriations act exempted farm bill conservation programs from select federal reporting requirements, including obtaining a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and System for Award Management (SAM) registration. Agriculture appropriations bills may also include policy-related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out the appropriation. The FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations acts both include policy provisions for conservation programs that range from reports to Congress to suggested natural resource priorities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3481}

DOL may also refer to the SCSEP program as Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act (OAA). The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019. In FY2019, SCSEP appropriations accounted for about 20% of the funding under the OAA. The bulk of SCSEP appropriations support two primary grant streams: one to national nonprofit organizations and one to state agencies. In the most recent program year, approximately 78% of formula grant funds were allocated to national grantees and about 22% were allocated to state grantees. Both the national organizations and state grantees subgrant funds to host agencies that provide the actual community service employment opportunities to participants. Host agencies are responsible for recruiting eligible participants. To be eligible for the program, prospective participants must be at least age 55, low-income, and unemployed. Federal law requires host agencies to give preference to prospective participants who demonstrate additional barriers to employment such as having a disability or being at risk of homelessness. Program participants work part-time in community service jobs, including employment at schools, libraries, social service organizations, or senior-serving organizations. Program participants earn the higher of minimum wage or the typical wage for the job in which they are employed. An individual may typically participate in the program for a cumulative total of no more than 48 months. During orientation, participants receive an assessment of their skills, interests, capabilities, and needs. This assessment informs the development of an individual employment plan (IEP). A participant's IEP is updated throughout their participation in the program. Grantees are subject to a performance accountability system. Performance metrics generally relate to participants' unsubsidized employment and earnings after exiting the program. In addition to outcome-based metrics, grantees are also assessed on participants' total number of hours of service and whether the grantee served participants with barriers to employment.

{"pred": "The report, published by a government agency in March 2018, provides an analysis of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (PTAB) CBM (Covered Business Method) program, which allows parties to challenge the validity of patents accused of infringement. From September 2012 to September 2017, 524 petitions were filed under the CBM program, challenging 359 distinct patents. The average number of monthly CBM petitions fluctuated during this period, with an average of 9 petitions per month in the early years, declining to fewer than 5 per month in the last fiscal year.\n\nThe decline in CBM petitions is attributed to several factors, including clarification of eligible patents by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, the targeting of low-quality business method patents in the early years of the program, and patent owners becoming more wary of asserting their intellectual property through infringement lawsuits. Some stakeholders expressed concern about multiple petitions being filed against the same patent, with concerns of increased costs and delaying district court proceedings.\n\nThe report found that the PTAB had completed reviews of 329 out of 359 patents challenged under the program, with about one-third of these patents having at least one claim ruled unpatentable. The PTAB's decisions are subject to different interpretations, with board judges ruling some or all of the patent claims unpatentable in 96.7% of the petitions for which a final written decision was issued, but only 35.6% of all cases.\n\nThe report also discusses the timeliness of decisions and the consistency of trial decisions and processes. The PTAB has taken steps to review issues affecting the consistency of its trial proceedings and decisions, and has engaged with stakeholders to improve its proceedings. The report concludes that the CBM program has reduced litigation involving business method patents, had minimal or mostly positive effects on innovation and investment, and has been valuable in eliminating overly broad, low-quality patents. The report recommends that the Director of USPTO develop guidance for judges reviewing the PTAB's decisions and processes, which the USPTO has agreed to address. The report also highlights the PTAB'", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's March 2018 report, entitled U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: Assessment of the Covered Business Method Patent Review Program ( GAO-18-320 ). From September 2012 through September 2017, entities facing patent infringement lawsuits filed 524 petitions challenging the validity of 359 patents under the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO) covered business method (CBM) program, resulting in decisions against about one-third of these patents. The CBM program provides entities facing infringement lawsuits an opportunity to challenge the validity of a business method patent by demonstrating that it did not meet requirements for patentability. Business method patents focus on ways of doing business in areas such as banking or e-commerce. The rate of filing petitions over this period has fluctuated but has generally declined since 2015, and none were filed in August or September 2017. USPTO has taken several steps to ensure the timeliness of trial decisions, review past decisions, and engage with stakeholders to improve proceedings under the program: Timeliness: USPTO regularly informs relevant parties about paperwork requirements and due dates throughout trials. According to program data, as of September 2017, all 181 completed trials were completed within statutorily required time frames. Decision review: USPTO has taken several steps to review its decisions and has monitored the rate at which the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms or reverses them. However, USPTO does not have guidance, such as documented procedures, for reviewing trial decisions, or the processes leading to decisions, for consistency. Without guidance, such as documented procedures, USPTO cannot fully ensure that it is meeting its objective of ensuring consistency of decisions. Stakeholder engagement: USPTO judges have engaged with stakeholders by participating in public roundtables and webinars, and attending judicial conferences, among other things. Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally agreed that the CBM program has reduced lawsuits involving business method patents in the federal courts. While many stakeholders favored maintaining aspects of the program, there was not strong consensus among stakeholders for how future trials should be designed."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2284}

The report outlines the U.S. nonproliferation activities, which are coordinated across multiple government agencies, international entities, national laboratories, industry, and academia. The report emphasizes the U.S.'s commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays a crucial role in verifying that nuclear material is not diverted for weapons or unauthorized purposes.\n\nThe report details the Administration's 2018 plan for nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring, which is more extensive than previous plans. The plan includes a roadmap for verification, detection, and monitoring, international engagement, R&D efforts, and the involvement of federal departments, military departments, national laboratories, industry, and academia. However, the plan does not provide estimates of future costs and funding needs, as required by the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\nThe report recommends that the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) should include estimates of future costs and funding needs in its plan for nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring. The NNSA did not agree or disagree with this recommendation, stating that it had briefed the appropriate congressional committees about the challenges of providing cost and funding data.\n\nThe report underscores the importance of cost and funding estimates for effective interagency planning and coordination, ensuring long-term strategic plans align with future activities and processes. The absence of such estimates in the NNSA's plan raises questions about the effectiveness of interagency coordination and the potential long-term funding needs for the diverse efforts supporting the proliferation verification and monitoring mission.", "answers": ["Countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a national security priority that is challenged by weapons advances from existing nuclear states and other actors possessing or attempting to possess nuclear weapons. To help address these issues, Congress directed the Administration in 2015 and 2017 to develop a plan for verification and monitoring relating to the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons, components of such weapons, and fissile material. GAO reviewed the first plan submitted to Congress in 2015, and an update submitted in 2017. GAO reported in March 2018 that this plan and update generally did not address the congressionally mandated reporting requirements. In the fiscal year 2018 NDAA, Congress directed the Administration to develop another plan and included a provision for GAO to review the plan. This report assesses whether the Administration's new plan provided details on the reporting requirements included in the NDAA. To determine whether the plan provided details on the reporting requirements, GAO reviewed the fiscal year 2018 plan and assessed whether the plan included details for each of the elements as required by the NDAA. GAO found that the 2018 plan provided details on most of the reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018, but did not include information on future costs and funding needs (see table below). In the NDAA, Congress directed the President to produce a plan that would address four reporting requirements: (1) a plan and roadmap on verification, detection and monitoring efforts, including details on costs and funding needs over 10 years, (2) an international engagement plan, (3) a research and development plan, and (4) a description of interagency engagement. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy, developed the plan and submitted it to Congress in April 2018. According to NNSA officials, NNSA did not include long-term costs and funding needs in the plan because identifying these needs is unrealistic for several reasons, including because agencies have little influence over the spending priorities of other departments outside of the President's budget process. However, NNSA and other agencies already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates for other programs. Because the plan does not include any estimates on future costs and funding needs, it limits congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation's verification and monitoring efforts and its ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. GAO has previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. GAO recommends that the Administrator of NNSA should include in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation, but said it planned no further action. GAO maintains that the recommendation is valid."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3249}
