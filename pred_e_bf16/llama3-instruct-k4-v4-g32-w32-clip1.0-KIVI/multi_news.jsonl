While the initial mission has been accomplished, what girls need now is encouragement to become leaders. The time has come to take them to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, to understand the responsibilities, roles, and rewards of leadership.\n\nAccording to Jennifer Allyn, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they need is encouragement to become leaders. In Fortune 500 companies, women make up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors. Companies need to do more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on an \"ambition gap.\"\n\nTo close the gap, companies can introduce girls to female role models, clearly explain what leaders of both genders do, and support programs throughout the year that actively identify and groom female talent. Introducing girls to a company's highest-ranking women can make a huge difference, as 80% of girls want to interact with successful women but 60% have not been offered the opportunity.\n\nGirls also need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis. They need to know how executives motivate teams, solve complex financial problems, and develop new products. Making leadership more tangible can help resolve issues such as girls feeling uncomfortable trying to lead or not thinking they are cut out for leadership.\n\nPrinceton University's efforts to move women into leadership roles are a model for other institutions. The university found that the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles had declined over the last decade. In response, the faculty started proactively encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\nIn corporate environments, sponsorship is key. Sponsors spend their political capital on behalf of their protégés, providing opportunities instead of merely advice. The best companies for diversity have formal sponsorship initiatives to achieve similar results.\n\nIn conclusion, simply showing our daughters what an office looks like is no longer enough.

Despite the lack of significant progress on key issues, both leaders expressed optimism about the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was seen as a win for Putin, who was able to set the tone and format of the discussion. The Russian leader was able to exclude certain members of Trump's team, including National Security Adviser HR McMaster and Senior Russia Adviser Fiona Hill, who are more skeptical of Russia's actions. The meeting also excluded any leaks, as only the two presidents, their foreign ministers, and two translators were present.\n\nThe two leaders discussed several issues, including Russia's election hacking and the possibility of a ceasefire in southwestern Syria. However, the US-Russia agreement on a ceasefire in Syria was seen as a minor achievement, and many in Washington remain concerned about Russia's actions.\n\nThe meeting comes amid ongoing investigations into whether Trump's presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Trump has denied any collusion, and Putin has denied Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.\n\nAhead of the meeting, three US senators wrote to Trump expressing \"deep concern\" about reports that the administration planned to discuss the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York to Russia.

These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish's blood from freezing, but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies.\n\nResearchers have found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This means that the fish can accumulate ice crystals in their bodies, which can persist for days or even weeks.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations to investigate the behavior of the antifreeze proteins.

After nearly seven years in various jails, authorities relocated Wang to a remote village, the Hindustan Times reports. He was not allowed to return to China, however, but nor was he given Indian citizenship. He lived in a kind of limbo. \"I cried in the night,\" Wang says of those first years in India. \"I missed my mother.\" He eventually married, worked at a flour mill, and had children and grandchildren, but he never stopped hoping to return home. A spokesperson for the Chinese government blames Indian bureaucracy for preventing Wang's return over the past half-century. But after being visited by a delegation from the Chinese embassy in recent weeks, visas were procured for Wang and his relatives. His wife was too sick to travel, but Wang arrived in Beijing on Friday with his adult children, where they were met by his surviving relatives. This is only a visit, however. \"My family is (in India),\" he says. \"Where would I go?\" (For this soldier, WWII didn't end until 1974.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2303}

{"pred": "The Pacific coast of North America is home to a vibrant and diverse marine ecosystem, which is largely dependent on the presence of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently in a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and experts are urging the council to take action to protect the sardine population.\n\nThe PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of sardines is not only affecting the fishing industry, but also the marine mammals, seabirds, and predators that rely on them for food.\n\nThe reason for the decline is unclear, but scientists believe that a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may be playing a role. The decline has been so severe that federal fishery managers have slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, and some environmental groups are calling for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with populations surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The species has a history of collapse, with a notable decline in the 1950s and a rebound in the 1980s. However, the current decline is the steepest since the mid-20th century, and experts warn that if sardines don't recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years.\n\nFor more information, please visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish or write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

This translates to approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year. The study analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011 and found that most of these unnecessary prescriptions are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe study also found that about 13 percent of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, and more than four in 10 of these prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions. However, half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health. The CDC has warned that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year in the United States.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for the goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020, as set by the White House.

They suggest that simple steps, such as displaying posters in patient waiting rooms, can help reduce antibiotic prescribing.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

{"pred": "A recent study by Pecan Street Research Institute has challenged the conventional wisdom that solar panels should face south to generate the most energy. The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is because west-facing panels capture solar energy late in the afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, coinciding with the time of peak demand.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are more likely to cover their own electrical use and reduce stress on utility grids during peak demand periods.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the residential solar market. Homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar, may now be able to install west-facing panels and generate more electricity. Additionally, utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they could benefit from reduced peak demand and increased grid reliability.\n\nWhile the study is not without its limitations, it highlights the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice rather than relying solely on theoretical assumptions. The results also suggest that the structure of incentives provided by utility companies plays a significant role in how consumers choose to orient their panels.\n\nOverall, the study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, making it more efficient and effective for homeowners and utility companies alike.", "answers": ["If you happen to have solar panels on your house, they might need a change of direction.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and gruel. His teeth were also heavily worn from chewing and using them as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that killed one of his front teeth, as well as a possible small stone in his gruel that may have contributed to his cavities and gum disease. The findings suggest that Ötzi's diet, which included an increase in starches from coarsely ground grain, may have contributed to the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth during the late Stone Age.\n\nIn addition to the dental study, an international team of researchers has sequenced Ötzi's entire genome, revealing new insights into his genetic makeup. The analysis shows that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite having none of the current risk factors such as being overweight, sedentary, or a smoker. This suggests that we may be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than previously thought.\n\nThe genome sequencing also revealed more about Ötzi's ancestors, including his paternal genes, which are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era.

Despite subsequent visits, no further sightings were reported, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries.\n\nHowever, a team of researchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Mexico's Ecology Institute, led by Daniel Mulcahy and Juan Martinez Gomez, suspected that the snake might still exist. They conducted an expedition to the island in May, following Beebe's original field notes and using DNA analysis to establish the species.\n\nThe team found 11 snakes matching Beebe's description, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion nightsnake is genetically distinct from others found in mainland Mexico. The species is found exclusively on the island and is now recognized as a full species.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also because of the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands are inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines, and the island's ecosystem is vulnerable to external threats.\n\nThe discovery is also a testament to the importance of historical data and museum collections in solving modern-day mysteries about biodiversity.

The virus, closely related to Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever that can have a high death rate. The patient's brother has developed symptoms similar to Marburg, and 80 people who came into contact with the victim have been quarantined, including 60 health-care workers.\n\n**Symptoms and Transmission**\n\nMarburg has an incubation period of five to 10 days, and symptoms include severe headache, myalgia, fever, and chills. The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, such as fruit bats.\n\n**Previous Outbreaks**\n\nMarburg has been linked to several outbreaks in the past, including a 1967 outbreak in Germany and Yugoslavia, and a 1998 outbreak in Uganda that infected 154 people and killed 128. Another large outbreak in Angola infected 252 people and killed 227 in 2004.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Marburg, but hospitalized patients can receive general supportive therapy. Experimental treatments are being developed, and Uganda has experience in controlling outbreaks of similar diseases.\n\n**Uganda's Response**\n\nUganda's Prime Minister, Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda, has assured that the country has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures to prevent a large-scale outbreak. The World Health Organization has been informed, and Uganda has experience in dealing with similar health threats.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Marburg is a deadly virus, it is not particularly easy to catch, and if an outbreak is identified early and controlled, it is unlikely to escalate like the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Uganda's response to the outbreak has been swift and effective, and the country's experience in controlling similar outbreaks gives confidence that the situation can be brought under control.", "answers": ["At least 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations in Uganda so far after State House Uganda confirmed a man died this week of the Marburg virus—a type of hemorrhagic fever that's strikingly similar to Ebola, CNN reports.

The church has been releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how Smith formed the faith, and has also issued a series of in-depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of the religion's history.\n\nThe Book of Mormon, which was first published in 1830, is a sacred text of the LDS Church and is considered to be a translation of an ancient record written on gold plates by the prophet Mormon. The book tells the story of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and their interactions with God. According to the church, the translation of the Book of Mormon was a miraculous event that was guided by God and involved the use of physical instruments, including the seer stone.\n\nThe church has also released new information about the translation process, including the fact that Joseph Smith was able to translate the book in just three months, from April to June of 1829. This is a remarkable feat, especially considering that Smith had very little formal education and was unable to write a book on his own. The church has also released new information about the scribes who assisted Smith during the translation process, including Oliver Cowdery, who is known as the primary scribe for the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has had a profound impact on the world, with over 168 million copies distributed since its publication. It has been translated into over 110 languages and is considered to be a sacred text by millions of people around the world. The church continues to distribute the book and make it available in digital formats, and it remains a central part of the LDS faith.", "answers": ["To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time. The images of the \"seer stone\" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting.\" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 7900}
{"pred": "Here is a one-page summary of the news:\n\nTennessee Senator Bob Corker, the retiring Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been engaged in a heated back-and-forth with President Donald Trump. Corker has criticized Trump's behavior, saying that he is \"steering the nation on the path to World War III\" and that he is \"like a toddler\" who needs to be contained. Trump has responded by calling Corker \"Liddle' Bob\" and saying that he is \"a negative voice\" who is standing in the way of the President's agenda.\n\nThe feud between Corker and Trump has escalated, with Trump tweeting that Corker \"begged\" for his endorsement before declining to run for re-election. Corker's chief of staff denied the claim, saying that Trump had asked Corker to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election and had reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him.\n\nThe clash between Corker and Trump highlights the fraying relations between the President and the men and women in Congress who the White House needs to deliver on the agenda Trump ran on. Trump has yet to score a signature legislative victory, a black mark on his record given his party controls both the Senate and House.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, has called on Corker to resign in response to his comments. The feud has also sparked a debate about the role of the press in reporting on the President's behavior, with some arguing that reporters should keep confidences and others saying that they have a duty to report the truth.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the loyalty of congressional Republicans to Trump, with some calling on them to take a stand against the President's behavior. As one commentator noted, \"For congressional Republicans, this is your moment in history's eye. One of your colleagues, who has chosen not to run for office again, and who also was the object of one of Trump's intemperate attacks this morning, has decided that he might as well tell the truth. It turns out that this is often the right way to go!\"", "answers": ["President Trump's feud with Republican Sen. Bob Corker is apparently still on, based on the new nickname the president bestowed upon Corker Tuesday morning. \"The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation,\" Trump tweeted. \"Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!\" Trump was referring to the interview Corker gave to the New York Times in which the senator likened the Trump White House to a \"reality show\" and suggested that reckless comments from the president could lead to World War III. Developments: Audio, transcript: The Times released excerpts from the interview, as well as audio here. It's not clear what Trump meant in saying that the newspaper set up Corker, but the transcript makes clear that Corker knew he was on the record, notes CNN. He also knew the call was being recorded, telling the reporter that his staff was recording it, \"and I hope you are, too.\" GOP trouble: At the National Journal, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report writes that Trump went to a \"darker place\" in his Corker criticism, and he now thinks the GOP majority is in jeopardy not only in the Senate but in the House. \"The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans,\" he writes. \"That's a tall order. And it's why last week's news reduced the odds of the GOP retaining its majority from a good bet to even money.\" Ulterior motives? Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry of the Week calls Corker a hypocrite for his sudden public turn on the president and suggests that the retiring senator is positioning himself to be an \"establishment\" primary challenger to the president in the 2020 election. Now what? James Fallows at the Atlantic writes that if Corker truly believes Trump might blunder his way into World War III, he has an obligation to \"do something about it\" by providing a crucial check on Trump's actions through his position as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. \"Talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts.\" WSJ weighs in: The conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal thinks Corker spoke the truth about the president's \"lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O'Donnell,\" and it hopes other top Republicans follow Corker's lead because it might actually help. Little reaction: NBC News rounds up reaction from top Republicans to Corker's statements about the president and finds \"silence or a shrug.\" A typical sentiment, from Marco Rubio: \"You'll have to ask Sen. Corker what led him to make that statement. I haven't made that statement.\" Trump's new criticism comes just a week before a Senate vote important to Trump's tax plan, notes the New York Times."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4346}
