While the initial mission has been accomplished, what girls need now is encouragement to become leaders. The time has come to take them to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, to understand the responsibilities, roles, and rewards of leadership.\n\nAccording to Jennifer Allyn, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they need is encouragement to become leaders. In Fortune 500 companies, women make up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors. Companies need to do more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on an \"ambition gap.\"\n\nTo close the gap, companies can introduce girls to female role models, clearly explain what leaders of both genders do, and support programs throughout the year that actively identify and groom female talent. Introducing girls to a company's highest-ranking women can make a huge difference, as 80% of girls want to interact with successful women but 60% have not been offered the opportunity.\n\nGirls also need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis. They need to know how executives motivate teams, solve complex financial problems, and develop new products. Making leadership more tangible can help resolve issues such as girls feeling uncomfortable trying to lead or not thinking they are cut out for leadership.\n\nPrinceton University's efforts to move women into leadership roles are a model for other institutions. The university found that the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles had declined over the last decade. In response, the faculty started proactively encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\nIn corporate environments, sponsorship is key. Sponsors spend their political capital on behalf of their protégés, providing opportunities instead of merely advice. The best companies for diversity have formal sponsorship initiatives to achieve similar results.\n\nIn conclusion, simply showing our daughters what an office looks like is no longer enough.

Despite the lack of significant progress on key issues, both leaders expressed optimism about the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was seen as a win for Putin, who was able to set the tone and format of the discussion. The Russian leader was able to exclude certain members of Trump's team, including National Security Adviser HR McMaster and Senior Russia Adviser Fiona Hill, who are more skeptical of Russia's actions. The meeting also excluded any leaks, as only the two presidents, their foreign ministers, and two translators were present.\n\nThe two leaders discussed several issues, including Russia's election hacking and the possibility of a ceasefire in southwestern Syria. However, the US-Russia agreement on a ceasefire in Syria was seen as a minor achievement, and many in Washington remain concerned about Russia's actions.\n\nThe meeting comes amid ongoing investigations into whether Trump's presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Trump has denied any collusion, and Putin has denied Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.\n\nAhead of the meeting, three US senators wrote to Trump expressing \"deep concern\" about reports that the administration planned to discuss the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York to Russia.

These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish's blood from freezing, but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies.\n\nResearchers have found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This means that the fish can accumulate ice crystals in their bodies, which can persist for days or even weeks.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations to investigate the behavior of the antifreeze proteins.

After nearly seven years in various jails, authorities relocated Wang to a remote village, the Hindustan Times reports. He was not allowed to return to China, however, but nor was he given Indian citizenship. He lived in a kind of limbo. \"I cried in the night,\" Wang says of those first years in India. \"I missed my mother.\" He eventually married, worked at a flour mill, and had children and grandchildren, but he never stopped hoping to return home. A spokesperson for the Chinese government blames Indian bureaucracy for preventing Wang's return over the past half-century. But after being visited by a delegation from the Chinese embassy in recent weeks, visas were procured for Wang and his relatives. His wife was too sick to travel, but Wang arrived in Beijing on Friday with his adult children, where they were met by his surviving relatives. This is only a visit, however. \"My family is (in India),\" he says. \"Where would I go?\" (For this soldier, WWII didn't end until 1974.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2303}

{"pred": "The Pacific coast of North America is home to a vibrant and diverse marine ecosystem, which is largely dependent on the presence of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently in a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and experts are urging the council to take action to protect the sardine population.\n\nThe PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of sardines is not only affecting the fishing industry, but also the marine mammals, seabirds, and predators that rely on them for food.\n\nThe reason for the decline is unclear, but scientists believe that a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may be playing a role. The decline has been so severe that federal fishery managers have slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, and some environmental groups are calling for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with populations surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The species has a history of collapse, with a notable decline in the 1950s and a rebound in the 1980s. However, the current decline is the steepest since the mid-20th century, and experts warn that if sardines don't recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years.\n\nFor more information, please visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish or write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

This translates to approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year. The study analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011 and found that most of these unnecessary prescriptions are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe study also found that about 13 percent of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, and more than four in 10 of these prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions. However, half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health. The CDC has warned that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year in the United States.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for the goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020, as set by the White House.

They suggest that simple steps, such as displaying posters in patient waiting rooms, can help reduce antibiotic prescribing.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

{"pred": "A recent study by Pecan Street Research Institute has challenged the conventional wisdom that solar panels should face south to generate the most energy. The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is because west-facing panels capture solar energy late in the afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, coinciding with the time of peak demand.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are more likely to cover their own electrical use and reduce stress on utility grids during peak demand periods.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the residential solar market. Homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar, may now be able to install west-facing panels and generate more electricity. Additionally, utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they could benefit from reduced peak demand and increased grid reliability.\n\nWhile the study is not without its limitations, it highlights the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice rather than relying solely on theoretical assumptions. The results also suggest that the structure of incentives provided by utility companies plays a significant role in how consumers choose to orient their panels.\n\nOverall, the study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, making it more efficient and effective for homeowners and utility companies alike.", "answers": ["If you happen to have solar panels on your house, they might need a change of direction.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and gruel. His teeth were also heavily worn from chewing and using them as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that killed one of his front teeth, as well as a possible small stone in his gruel that may have contributed to his cavities and gum disease. The findings suggest that Ötzi's diet, which included an increase in starches from coarsely ground grain, may have contributed to the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth during the late Stone Age.\n\nIn addition to the dental study, an international team of researchers has sequenced Ötzi's entire genome, revealing new insights into his genetic makeup. The analysis shows that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite having none of the current risk factors such as being overweight, sedentary, or a smoker. This suggests that we may be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than previously thought.\n\nThe genome sequencing also revealed more about Ötzi's ancestors, including his paternal genes, which are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era.

Despite subsequent visits, no further sightings were reported, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries.\n\nHowever, a team of researchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Mexico's Ecology Institute, led by Daniel Mulcahy and Juan Martinez Gomez, suspected that the snake might still exist. They conducted an expedition to the island in May, following Beebe's original field notes and using DNA analysis to establish the species.\n\nThe team found 11 snakes matching Beebe's description, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion nightsnake is genetically distinct from others found in mainland Mexico. The species is found exclusively on the island and is now recognized as a full species.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also because of the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands are inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines, and the island's ecosystem is vulnerable to external threats.\n\nThe discovery is also a testament to the importance of historical data and museum collections in solving modern-day mysteries about biodiversity.

The virus, closely related to Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever that can have a high death rate. The patient's brother has developed symptoms similar to Marburg, and 80 people who came into contact with the victim have been quarantined, including 60 health-care workers.\n\n**Symptoms and Transmission**\n\nMarburg has an incubation period of five to 10 days, and symptoms include severe headache, myalgia, fever, and chills. The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, such as fruit bats.\n\n**Previous Outbreaks**\n\nMarburg has been linked to several outbreaks in the past, including a 1967 outbreak in Germany and Yugoslavia, and a 1998 outbreak in Uganda that infected 154 people and killed 128. Another large outbreak in Angola infected 252 people and killed 227 in 2004.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Marburg, but hospitalized patients can receive general supportive therapy. Experimental treatments are being developed, and Uganda has experience in controlling outbreaks of similar diseases.\n\n**Uganda's Response**\n\nUganda's Prime Minister, Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda, has assured that the country has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures to prevent a large-scale outbreak. The World Health Organization has been informed, and Uganda has experience in dealing with similar health threats.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Marburg is a deadly virus, it is not particularly easy to catch, and if an outbreak is identified early and controlled, it is unlikely to escalate like the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Uganda's response to the outbreak has been swift and effective, and the country's experience in controlling similar outbreaks gives confidence that the situation can be brought under control.", "answers": ["At least 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations in Uganda so far after State House Uganda confirmed a man died this week of the Marburg virus—a type of hemorrhagic fever that's strikingly similar to Ebola, CNN reports.

The church has been releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how Smith formed the faith, and has also issued a series of in-depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of the religion's history.\n\nThe Book of Mormon, which was first published in 1830, is a sacred text of the LDS Church and is considered to be a translation of an ancient record written on gold plates by the prophet Mormon. The book tells the story of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and their interactions with God. According to the church, the translation of the Book of Mormon was a miraculous event that was guided by God and involved the use of physical instruments, including the seer stone.\n\nThe church has also released new information about the translation process, including the fact that Joseph Smith was able to translate the book in just three months, from April to June of 1829. This is a remarkable feat, especially considering that Smith had very little formal education and was unable to write a book on his own. The church has also released new information about the scribes who assisted Smith during the translation process, including Oliver Cowdery, who is known as the primary scribe for the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has had a profound impact on the world, with over 168 million copies distributed since its publication.

The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune.

The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history.

Trump has responded by calling Corker \"Liddle' Bob\" and saying that he is \"a negative voice\" who is standing in the way of the President's agenda.\n\nThe feud between Corker and Trump has escalated, with Trump tweeting that Corker \"begged\" for his endorsement before declining to run for re-election. Corker's chief of staff denied the claim, saying that Trump had asked Corker to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election and had reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him.\n\nThe clash between Corker and Trump highlights the fraying relations between the President and the men and women in Congress who the White House needs to deliver on the agenda Trump ran on. Trump has yet to score a signature legislative victory, a black mark on his record given his party controls both the Senate and House.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, has called on Corker to resign in response to his comments. The feud has also sparked a debate about the role of the press in reporting on the President's behavior, with some arguing that reporters should keep confidences and others saying that they have a duty to report the truth.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the loyalty of congressional Republicans to Trump, with some calling on them to take a stand against the President's behavior. As one commentator noted, \"For congressional Republicans, this is your moment in history's eye.

The discovery has sparked renewed debate about Pluto's status as a planet, with some arguing that it should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown and other scientists argue that Pluto is not a planet, but rather a dwarf planet, and that the solar system is better understood with eight dominant objects, rather than nine.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also led to a reevaluation of the definition of a planet, with some scientists suggesting that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) may need to revisit its criteria for what constitutes a planet. The IAU defines a planet as an object that orbits the sun, has sufficient mass to assume a hydrostatic equilibrium shape, and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Planet Nine, however, does not meet the third criterion, as its orbit overlaps with that of other objects in the Kuiper Belt.\n\nDespite the controversy, Brown and other scientists are excited about the discovery of Planet Nine, which they believe will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.

The pilot, Captain Patrick Sondenheimer, can be heard trying to break open the door and shouting \"For God's sake open the door!\" as the plane crashes.\n\nFrench authorities have confirmed that Lubitz was suffering from depression and had been treated for vision problems, which could have ended his flying career.

Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak.

This discrepancy has sparked a debate among scientists, with some suggesting that the universe may be filled with unknown subatomic particles or that Einstein's theory of relativity is incomplete.\n\nThe new measurements were made by analyzing the light from distant galaxies and using a type of star called Cepheid variables as a \"cosmic yardstick\" to calculate distances. The researchers also used Type Ia supernovae as a standard candle to measure the expansion rate. The findings have been published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the universe, as it suggests that the distance between galaxies will double in about 9.8 billion years. It also raises questions about the nature of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, which make up about 95 percent of the universe but are not well understood.\n\nSome scientists have suggested that the discrepancy could be due to unknown subatomic particles or that Einstein's theory of relativity is incomplete.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here.

The film, based on Roald Dahl's beloved children's book, was expected to be a commercial success, but its poor performance has left many wondering what went wrong. The film's budget was $140 million, making it a significant financial risk for Disney.\n\nSeveral factors have been cited as contributing to the film's poor performance. One is the lack of awareness about the book among modern families, which may have made it difficult for the film to attract a large audience. Another is the film's confusing title, which may have been off-putting to some viewers. Additionally, the film's lack of recognizable faces and its steep budget may have made it a hard sell for some viewers.\n\nThe film's poor performance has also raised questions about Spielberg's ability to connect with modern audiences. While he has had success with films like \"Lincoln\" and \"Bridge of Spies\", his more recent films have not performed as well at the box office. Some have speculated that Spielberg's focus on more serious, adult-oriented films may have alienated him from his traditional audience of families and children.\n\nDespite the film's poor performance, Spielberg remains one of the most successful filmmakers in Hollywood, with a long history of hits like \"E.T.\" and \"Jurassic Park\". His next film, \"Ready Player One\", is expected to be a major success, and he has several other projects in the works.\n\nOverall, the poor performance of \"The BFG\" is a setback for Spielberg and Disney, but it is not a catastrophic failure.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The practice was introduced by Joseph Smith, the church's founder, in the 1840s and was practiced by some members of the church for over 50 years. Plural marriage was seen as a commandment from God and was believed to be a way to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant. However, it was also a source of controversy and opposition, both within and outside the church.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced gradually, with Joseph Smith marrying multiple wives and authorizing other church members to do the same. The practice was not publicly acknowledged until the church moved to Utah, where it became a central part of the church's doctrine and practice.\n\nHowever, in 1890, the church's president, Wilford Woodruff, issued a manifesto stating that the church would no longer practice plural marriage. This decision was made in response to increasing opposition from the US government and the public. The church has since officially disavowed the practice of plural marriage, and it is no longer practiced by members of the church.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding plural marriage, many members of the church have testified to the spiritual benefits they experienced as a result of the practice. They have reported feeling a sense of peace and happiness, and have credited the practice with helping them to grow spiritually and become more like Christ.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of plural marriage in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is complex and multifaceted.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, analyzed data from over 5,000 California high school seniors and found that the use of e-cigarettes is not just a substitute for traditional tobacco products, but is actually increasing the number of teenagers who use nicotine.\n\nThe study found that in 2014, 14% of high school seniors in California reported using e-cigarettes, and that this number has been increasing rapidly over the past few years. The researchers also found that the use of e-cigarettes is not just limited to teenagers who would have otherwise used traditional tobacco products, but is also being used by teenagers who would not have otherwise used nicotine.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Jessica Barrington-Trimis, said that the findings suggest that e-cigarettes are not a safe alternative to traditional tobacco products, and that they are actually increasing the number of teenagers who use nicotine. \"E-cigarettes are not a harmless alternative to smoking,\" she said. \"They are a gateway to nicotine addiction, and they are increasing the number of teenagers who use nicotine.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with other research that has shown that e-cigarettes are not a safe alternative to traditional tobacco products.

The experts who reviewed the evidence also raised the possibility that the DNA on JonBenet's clothing may have been transferred innocently, rather than being evidence of a crime.\n\nThe findings have raised questions about Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramseys and have sparked a renewed debate about the case. Some experts believe that the DNA evidence is still significant and points to an intruder as the killer, while others argue that the case is still too complex to be solved by DNA alone.\n\nThe Ramseys have always maintained their innocence, and their son Burke has recently filed a defamation suit against a forensic pathologist who claimed he was involved in the murder. The case remains cold, but Boulder police continue to investigate new leads and tips.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the case has also led to criticism of Lacy's handling of the investigation, with some accusing her of being too close to the Ramsey family and losing her objectivity. The current Boulder County District Attorney, Stan Garnett, has said that the case is still open and that there is not enough admissible evidence to charge anyone with the crime.", "answers": ["After just short of 20 years, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is as much of a mystery as ever—especially in light of a new examination of DNA evidence. A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,\" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) \"I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track.\" Comparison to the DNA profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects.

Snooki has been open about her partying ways, but her pregnancy has raised concerns about the potential risks of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) to her unborn child.\n\n**Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)**\n\nFAS is a condition caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, which can result in physical, behavioral, and cognitive disabilities. The condition was first identified in 1973 and is now recognized as a leading cause of intellectual disability. FAS can occur in any child whose mother consumes alcohol during pregnancy, regardless of the amount or frequency of consumption.\n\n**Symptoms of FAS**\n\nCommon symptoms of FAS include facial abnormalities, growth deficiency, and central nervous system damage. Children with FAS may experience developmental delays, hyperactivity, and behavioral problems. Secondary disabilities can emerge later in life, including mental health issues, trouble with the law, and employment difficulties.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nThe only way to prevent FAS is to avoid alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Treatment for FAS is focused on addressing the individual's specific needs and disabilities, including behavioral interventions, educational support, and medical care.\n\n**History of FAS**\n\nFAS was first identified in 1973 by Drs.

That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The hospital's president, Gay Nord, has denied that the financial struggles have affected patient care, but several current and former physicians have expressed concerns about the impact of the hospital's financial woes on patient care.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability in the hospital's handling of patient care and the need for patients and families to be better informed about the risks and outcomes of heart transplant surgery.", "answers": ["Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center is one of America's most storied hospitals when it comes to heart transplants. Or was. Though some of the first heart transplants took place at the Houston hospital, things have disintegrated to the point that it now \"has had some of the worst heart transplant outcomes in the country.\" So write Mike Hixenbaugh and Charles Ornstein in a story co-published by the Houston Chronicle and ProPublica. Their joint investigation found an elevated death and complication count for heart transplant patients there, whose one-year survival rate \"now ranks near the bottom nationally\" at 85% for those who got a new heart between mid-2014 and 2016; the national rate was 91.4%. Hixenbaugh and Ornstein add a face to those stats via the story of James \"Lee\" Lewis. Word came on Jan. 1, 2018, that St. Luke's had a heart for Lewis—news that brought hope the 52-year-old would be able to walk his daughter down the aisle in June. But by March 23, he was dead, having never left the hospital. What happened in between is a series of missteps, starting with the Jan. 2 transplant. Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10507}
{"pred": "A 41-year-old man, Gilbert Flores, was shot and killed by two Bexar County Sheriff's deputies in a domestic disturbance call in San Antonio, Texas. The incident was captured on video, which shows Flores standing with his hands up before being shot. The deputies, Greg Vasquez and Robert Sanchez, have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nThis incident is one of many officer-involved shootings in Bexar County, which has seen at least 35 people killed by law enforcement since 2010. The San Antonio Express-News has compiled a list of these incidents, which includes a range of circumstances, from armed robberies to domestic disturbances.\n\nIn one notable incident, a 19-year-old man, Daryll Blair, was shot and killed by police after allegedly crashing a stolen police-issued Ford Explorer and charging at officers with a shotgun. In another, a 47-year-old man, Daniel Schuck, was shot and killed by police after firing a gun at officers who had responded to a domestic disturbance call.\n\nThe Express-News has also reported on several incidents in which officers have been cleared of wrongdoing in the use of deadly force. In one case, a 14-year-old boy, Derek Lopez, was shot and killed by a Northside ISD police officer after punching another student at a bus stop.\n\nThe use of deadly force by law enforcement is a controversial issue, with some arguing that it is necessary to protect officers and others, while others argue that it is often used disproportionately against minorities and the mentally ill. The Express-News's compilation of officer-involved shootings in Bexar County highlights the need for transparency and accountability in these incidents.", "answers": ["A disturbing video shot Friday in Texas appears to show the fatal police shooting of a suspect while his arms are raised in surrender. The KSAT video, which runs more than four minutes and was shot from a distance, shows two Bexar County Sheriff deputies, Greg Vasquez and Robert Sanchez, approach Gilbert Flores in a San Antonio neighborhood after a call about a domestic dispute. Around the one-minute mark, Flores raises his arms and the officers appear to fire at least two shots from about 10 yards away. Flores appears to slouch forward before falling to the ground. An officer approaches Flores' seemingly lifeless body 30 seconds later, grabs his arm, and drags him along the ground. An ambulance arrives just before the video ends. Police say they first tried to subdue Flores, 41, with a Taser and shield before shooting him, per the San Antonio Express-News. It isn't clear how many shots were fired or how many times Flores was hit. Police say the 20-minute encounter began when officers visited a home in the area to find a bleeding woman with a cut on her head, holding a baby who may have been injured, per KSAT. They say Flores, who had a criminal record, was there holding a knife. \"Certainly, what's in the video is a cause for concern,\" a sheriff tells the New York Daily News. \"But it's important to let the investigation go through its course.\" A district attorney agrees the video is \"troubling,\" telling KSAT, \"There's actually another video with a better view that is very close.\" He adds, \"There's a lot of information before, including 911 calls and information from different witnesses inside the house.\" On Facebook, Bexar County police slam KSAT for posting the video, calling the move \"unethical and sad\" and \"sensational behavior,\" noting it has resulted in \"physical threats toward our deputies.\" Vasquez and Sanchez are both on administrative leave."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8009}
{"pred": "Hurricane Michael, a powerful Category 4 storm, made landfall in Florida on October 10, bringing catastrophic winds and flooding to the Panhandle region. The storm has left a trail of destruction, with at least 17 deaths reported across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. The death toll is expected to rise as search-and-rescue teams continue to comb through ravaged neighborhoods.\n\nThe hardest-hit area is Mexico Beach, a small town of about 1,000 people that was nearly wiped off the map. The town's residents were warned to evacuate, but at least 285 people defied the orders and stayed behind. The fate of these individuals is still unknown, and authorities are working to account for the missing.\n\nThe storm's impact was felt across the Southeast, with over 1.5 million people without power. The National Hurricane Center has discontinued all coastal tropical cyclone warnings and watches, but the storm's remnants are still bringing heavy rain and flash flooding to parts of the region.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator William \"Brock\" Long warned that the death toll will likely rise as search-and-rescue teams reach the most affected areas. He also expressed frustration that people do not always heed evacuation orders, saying, \"When state and local officials tell you to get out, dang it, do it. Get out.\"\n\nThe storm has also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including Tyndall Air Force Base, which was severely damaged and is expected to be closed for an extended period. The base's commander, Col. Brian Laidlaw, has told personnel not to return to the base until it is safe to do so.\n\nAs the region begins the long process of recovery, authorities are working to distribute food, water, and other supplies to those affected by the storm.

As has been well reported by now, the coastal community was decimated by the storm, and authorities are now trying to figure out how many of those 285 survived. Similar situations exist elsewhere in the state, and Florida officials are fielding scores of calls from worried loved ones. Still, with cellphone service down throughout wide areas, rescue officials are holding out hope that the missing are fine and simply haven't been able to get in touch yet. As of Friday afternoon, CNN had the death toll at 13: Five in Virginia, four in Florida, three in North Carolina, and one (an 11-year-old girl) in Georgia. “Unfortunately, I think you’re going to see that number climb,” said FEMA Administrator William “Brock” Long Friday morning. “I hope we don’t see it climb dramatically.” As for the storm itself, the Washington Post notes that Michael is now Post-Tropical Cyclone Michael and has moved out to sea. However, communities from New Jersey to Massachusetts could still get 3 to 5 inches of rain through Friday.
