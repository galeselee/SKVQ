However, the problem of women's underrepresentation in leadership positions remains. According to Jennifer Allyn, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, what girls need now is encouragement to become leaders, and it's time to take them to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work.\n\nThe lack of women in leadership positions is not due to a lack of ambition, but rather a lack of support and opportunities. Companies need to do more to inspire women to lead, and one way to achieve this is by introducing girls to female role models and providing them with sponsorship and opportunities. A recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80 percent of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60 percent have not been offered the opportunity to do so.\n\nTo address this issue, companies can shift their focus on Take Our Children to Work Day to include introducing girls to female role models, explaining what leaders do on a day-to-day basis, and supporting programs that identify and groom female talent. This can be achieved by introducing girls to the company's highest-ranking women, highlighting their accomplishments, and providing them with opportunities and sponsorship.\n\nThe importance of sponsorship is highlighted by the example of Princeton University, which found that the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles had declined over the last decade. The university's president convened a steering committee to investigate and recommend solutions, resulting in the faculty starting to proactively encourage female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\nIn conclusion, taking our daughters to the C-suite is not just a symbolic gesture, but a necessary step towards achieving gender equality in leadership positions. By providing girls with opportunities, sponsorship, and role models, we can inspire them to become leaders and make a tangible difference in their careers and the world.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is concise and easy to read:\n\n**Taking Daughters to the C-Suite: A Call to Action for Women's Leadership**\n\nAs we mark the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, it's clear that the initial mission to demystify the workplace for girls has been accomplished.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which prevent the fish's blood from freezing in the freezing waters of Antarctica, have been found to also inhibit the melting of ice crystals in the fish's bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals in their veins for most of their lives, which could be a life-threatening condition.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of marine biologists who studied the fish's blood and found that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and prevent them from growing or melting. The researchers also found that the fish's bodies are able to tolerate the presence of ice crystals, but the long-term effects of this condition are still unknown.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the ice crystals in the fish's bodies do not melt at their expected melting point, but instead remain intact even at temperatures above 30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

The fish, which are a staple food source for many species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish, have seen their numbers plummet to historic lows. The Pacific Fishery Management Council, responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to take action to protect the sardine population.\n\nThe council is being asked to set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and to fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of sardines has already had a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many predators struggling to find food. For example, brown pelicans, sea lions, and other marine mammals are starving due to the lack of sardines.\n\nScientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but natural climate cycles and overfishing are suspected to be contributing factors. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a naturally occurring climate cycle, has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, which has repelled sardines. Additionally, the sardine population has been heavily exploited in the past, leading to concerns that the current decline may be exacerbated by continued fishing.\n\nThe decline of sardines has significant economic implications, as the fish are worth billions of dollars when left in the water. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force estimates that forage fish worldwide are worth $11.3 billion when left in the water, compared to $5.6 billion when caught.\n\nThe Pacific sardine fishery has a history of boom and bust cycles, with the population fluctuating wildly over the decades.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same.

The study, which analyzed a representative sample of over 11,000 adults in the US, found that only 2% of the population currently follows a vegetarian or vegan diet, while 10% have done so in the past but now consume meat.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that lapses in vegetarian or vegan diets are often due to social pressures, difficulty in maintaining the diet, and lack of support. Many former vegetarians and vegans (65%) transitioned to their diet in just a few days or weeks, which may contribute to their inability to stick to it. Additionally, a third of all former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarian or non-vegan partner, which may have influenced their decision to abandon their diet.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of relationships in maintaining a vegetarian or vegan diet. Current vegetarians were more likely to cite multiple reasons for their diet, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health, while former vegetarians were more likely to cite health as the main motivator. The study suggests that advocates should focus on promoting a reduction in animal product consumption rather than complete elimination, as this may be a more effective approach.\n\nOne individual's personal account, published in a blog post, shares their own experience of transitioning from a vegetarian to a meat-eater. The author, who had previously given up meat due to social pressures and a desire to fit in, eventually returned to eating meat after feeling pressured by his wife's cravings during pregnancy.

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1889}

The agreement, announced by President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, sets ambitious targets for both countries to reduce emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources.\n\n**US Commitments**\n\nThe US has committed to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. This represents a significant increase in the pace of emissions reductions, with a goal of reducing emissions by 2.3-2.8% per year between 2020 and 2025. The US has also pledged to double the rate of emissions reductions compared to the previous period, and to submit its new 2025 emissions reduction target to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by the end of 2015.\n\n**China Commitments**\n\nChina has set a target to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by around 2030, with the goal of reaching peak emissions earlier if possible. The country has also committed to increase the share of its energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources, such as renewable and nuclear energy, to around 20% by 2030. This will require the development of up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power generation capacity from sources like wind, solar, and nuclear energy.\n\n**Global Impact**\n\nThe joint US-China agreement is seen as a major breakthrough in the fight against climate change, and is expected to inject momentum into global climate negotiations. The two countries account for around 40% of the world's emissions, and their cooperation is crucial to achieving a global agreement on climate change. The agreement is also seen as a milestone in the US-China relationship, marking a significant shift in the two countries' approach to climate change.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe US-China agreement is a significant step forward in the global effort to combat climate change. The ambitious targets set by both countries demonstrate their commitment to reducing emissions and transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity in a day and generated more electricity during peak demand hours, reducing grid dependence by 65% compared to 54% for south-facing panels.\n\nThe research, which was conducted during the summer months, suggests that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy during the late afternoon, when energy demand is highest. This is because most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning during this time, creating a surge in energy demand.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the residential solar market. It means that homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar, may actually be good candidates after all. Additionally, the study suggests that homeowners with south-facing roofs may benefit from installing west-facing panels, especially if their utility company offers pricing differentiation between peak and off-peak hours.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Brewster McCracken, hopes that the findings will prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

The study, which analyzed data from 24 different sources, including satellites, ground measurements, and computer simulations, found that the ice loss has increased significantly over the past few years, with West Antarctica losing more than 241 billion tons of ice per year from 2012 to 2017.\n\nThe study's authors warn that the situation is dire and that the ice sheet is in a state of collapse.

As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60.

Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak.

(Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia.

Trump and Kim exchanged signed documents, and Trump said that the meeting was \"very, very good\" and that he and Kim had developed an \"excellent relationship.\" Kim, in turn, said that he and Trump had \"decided to leave the past behind.\"\n\nThe summit was met with skepticism by critics, who argued that it unduly elevated North Korea's rogue regime and ignored human rights abuses and other issues. Some analysts predicted that the meeting would not yield a comprehensive nuclear deal, but rather set up a process for future negotiations.\n\nIn the lead-up to the summit, Trump tweeted about the meeting, saying that it was a \"major loss\" for the U.S. and that the \"haters and losers\" were criticizing him. He also said that the meeting was a \"real deal\" and that he would know soon whether or not a deal could be made.\n\nThe meeting was marked by a focus on building a relationship between the two leaders, with Trump and Kim chatting amiably and posing for photos together. The summit was seen as a major step forward in the U.S.-North Korea relationship, but its long-term impact remains to be seen.assistant\n\nYour summary is concise and accurately captures the main points of the news articles.

After the ceremonial introduction, the two men met with only their interpreters in tow, then walked together along a balcony as they headed to a larger meeting with aides. Trump told reporters from the balcony that the meeting was \"very, very good\" and predicted he and Kim \"will solve a big problem, a big dilemma,\" reports the AP.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

FASD is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure and can result in a range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive problems.\n\n**Prevalence and Prevention**\n\nFASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. The risk of FAS is about 1.5% for women who drink any quantity of alcohol during pregnancy, and 50% for women who drink large quantities. Drinking during pregnancy can cause a range of problems, including intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and physical abnormalities.\n\n**History and Recognition**\n\nFAS was first identified and named in 1973 by Drs.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Using a device that detects patterns in brain activity, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions, and even express their quality of life. The study, published in the journal Plos Biology, involved four patients who were trained to use the system, which uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect changes in blood flow in the brain.\n\nThe patients, who were all fed through tubes and kept alive on ventilators, were asked to think \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France.\" The device was able to learn to distinguish the brain activity patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient, and the patients were able to answer questions with an accuracy rate of over 70%.\n\nThe study also explored the patients' quality of life, and surprisingly, all four patients reported being \"happy\" with their lives. This suggests that locked-in syndrome may not be the living hell that many people assume it to be.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer.

And it's apparently much worse for girls than for boys, a deputy director for the group says. \"Iran continues to lag behind the rest of the world, maintaining laws that permit girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to be sentenced to death,\" says Said Boumedouha. This in spite of supposedly significant changes to the country's Islamic Penal Code—changes meant to offer judges \"alternative punishments\" to the death penalty when juveniles are involved. In fact, the need for those changes in the first place shows what a dismal failure Iran has been in dealing with this issue, since in 1994 it ratified its participation in the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that \"neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed [on] … persons below 18 years of age.\" \"The report debunks recent attempts by Iran's authorities to whitewash their continuing violations of children's rights and deflect criticism of their appalling record as one of the world's last executioners of juvenile offenders,\" the Amnesty report reads.

The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared.

{"pred": "Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has introduced a new \"Medicare for all\" health care bill, which aims to provide comprehensive health care services to all Americans. The bill, which has been endorsed by nearly a third of the Senate Democratic caucus, would eliminate premiums, deductibles, and co-pays for private health insurance, and instead require Americans to pay a smaller share of their income to fund the program. The plan would also allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices and would not cover long-term care, which would be addressed in separate legislation.\n\nThe bill has been praised by progressive activists and some Democratic lawmakers, who see it as a step towards creating a more equitable and affordable health care system. However, the plan is likely to face significant opposition from Republicans, who have repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and have expressed concerns about the cost and feasibility of a single-payer system.\n\nThe bill's introduction comes after Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, during which he made Medicare for all a central issue. Since then, the idea has gained popularity among some Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have all announced their support for the bill.\n\nThe plan's financing has not been fully explained, but Sanders has said that it would be paid for through a combination of new taxes, including a 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers, and higher taxes on the wealthy. The bill would also phase out the current system over a four-year transition period, starting with a beefed-up Medicare program and gradually expanding eligibility to all Americans.\n\nWhile the bill is unlikely to pass in its current form, it marks a significant shift in the national conversation about health care and may influence the Democratic Party's platform and policy priorities in the future.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is more concise and easy to read:\n\nBernie Sanders has introduced a new \"Medicare for all\" bill, which aims to provide comprehensive health care services to all Americans.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating.

Monson—who was ordained as a bishop at the age of 22 and became one of the church's apostles at 36—had led the church for almost a decade and largely remained behind the scenes during a tumultuous 10 years for the church, though he was well-known for helping the needy and often turned up unannounced at funerals or at the bedsides of the ill, reports the Salt Lake Tribune, which describes him as an \"affable leader\" and a \"folksy preacher.\" Monson, who was born in Salt Lake City and served in the Navy during World War II, was president of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for 13 years before becoming church leader. The AP reports that he's likely to be remembered for his humanitarian work, for lowering the minimum age for missionaries to 18 for men and 19 for women—and for leading his church's support of California's same-sex marriage ban in 2008. The Deseret News notes that Monson also, as chairman of the Missionary Executive Committee, assigned the first black Mormon missionary.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing.

And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores.
