He was also a significant philanthropist, particularly in African-American education and culture.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on thousands of children in the rural South, as he helped fund the construction of over 5,300 schools, many of which were named after him. These schools, known as Rosenwald schools, provided education to African-American children who were previously denied access to quality education due to segregation.\n\nThe documentary \"Rosenwald\" tells the story of his life and work, featuring interviews with prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond. These individuals, who attended Rosenwald schools, share their experiences and express gratitude for the opportunities Rosenwald's philanthropy provided them.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy extended beyond education. He also provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country and developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fish species, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's blood, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins.\n\nThe studies, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveal that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This means that even during summer warming episodes, the ice crystals do not melt as expected, posing a potential risk to the fish's health.\n\nResearchers found that the ice crystals persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1°C above their expected melting point for at least 24 hours, and at a lower temperature for several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes. Over a long-term record (1999–2012), seawater temperature surpassed the fish's expected melting point in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes.\n\nThe accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins could potentially cause damage, particularly in small capillaries. However, the study suggests that there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation, and further research is needed to understand the long-term cost of having the AFPs and the potential adverse effects on the fish's bodies.\n\nThe findings provide insights into the evolutionary process, demonstrating that every good evolutionary innovation may come with potentially bad or unintended consequences. The study of notothenioid fish species offers a unique opportunity to understand the progression of species and the trade-offs involved in adaptation to extreme environments.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has plummeted to its lowest level in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline is causing concern among scientists and environmental groups, who fear that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if the sardines do not recover soon. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may be a factor.\n\nThe PFMC has already slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups argue that the catch should be halted entirely to allow the sardine population to recover. The sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, and history shows that it will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is also causing concern for the health of other marine species. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013. Research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines and instead fed on less nutritious alternatives, leading to malnourished pups.\n\nForage fish, such as sardines, account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 20", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

During a Q&A session, audience members accused the film of being racist and perpetuating stereotypes, particularly in its handling of homosexuality. The film's comedy, which includes scenes that some critics find offensive, has been defended by the film's stars and producers as a satire, not a representation, of stereotypes. The controversy has sparked debates about the film's intent and impact, with opinions ranging from it being a commentary on contemporary issues of inequality and race to being disappointingly unfunny.\n\nOn a different note, Alexa Internet, a company known for web traffic data, has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011, which represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in the United States. The studies found that more than 44% of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, and half of these prescriptions are unnecessary.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs. The CDC has warned about the rise of these superbugs in recent years, posing a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide.\n\nThe studies suggest that a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary to meet the White House's goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020.\n\nHealthcare providers, patients, and the healthcare industry as a whole can take action to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

The study, which was conducted in Austin, Texas, analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, comparing the energy production and electricity usage during peak demand hours of homes with west-facing and south-facing solar panels.\n\nThe results showed that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours of 3 to 7pm, compared to south-facing panels. West-facing panels also reduced homeowners' peak energy usage by 65%, while south-facing panels reduced usage by 54%.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels may be more effective for many homeowners because they capture solar energy late in the afternoon, which coincides with the time when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, thus optimizing solar power generation during peak usage hours.\n\nThe study has the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, as it opens up the possibility for homeowners with west-facing roofs to harness solar energy more effectively. It also means that homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's unclear how the results would be affected during winter months when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes.\n\nThe study has received mixed reactions from industry experts.

Six papers released by the journal Science detail the rover's discoveries, providing insights into Mars' early epochs, approximately three to four billion years ago. The findings suggest that early Mars was in many ways similar to Earth, potentially supporting microbial life.\n\nOne of the key discoveries is the evidence of an ancient Martian lake, which could have supported life as we know it for long periods, possibly millions of years. This lake, located in Gale Crater, was likely fed by streams originating from mountains and covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide crater. The lake's sedimentary rocks, known as mudstones, contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of the ancient freshwater lake.\n\nThe lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. These microbes are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on Earth.\n\nThe lake is estimated to have existed for at least tens of thousands of years, and possibly much longer. The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis.\n\nCuriosity's mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover's analysis of the mudstones has confirmed and extended its landmark discovery, providing a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago.\n\nWhile Curiosity has not been designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars, the discovery of a potentially habitable environment for chemolithoautotrophs opens up the possibility that life may have existed on Mars in the past. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of the ancient lake, Curiosity has also made progress in its search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds. While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far, their origin remains unclear due to the presence of a chlorine-based compound and an organic solvent that may have contaminated the samples.", "answers": ["The Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of an ancient freshwater lake on Mars that was brimming with the key chemicals necessary to support microbial life, and its findings suggest that it could have held that life more recently than we thought—and possibly for millions of years before that. \"Quite honestly it just looks very Earth-like,\" the Curiosity's lead scientist said, according to Space.com.

The genome analysis reveals that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, a condition associated with risk factors such as being overweight, lack of exercise, smoking, and drinking. However, as a hunter-gatherer, Ötzi did not have these risk factors, suggesting that our understanding of preventing arteriosclerosis may be limited.\n\nThe genome sequencing also places Ötzi in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, indicating that his paternal genes are linked to a population that migrated from the Near East to Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era.

In an interview with People magazine around the same time, Taylor accused Russell of physical abuse. Russell denied the allegations, stating that the show had pushed them to the limit.\n\nThe couple's relationship had been tumultuous, with their marital issues being a central theme in the first season of the show. Russell was portrayed as a grumpy and distant husband, often leaving parties early and being accused of being unaffectionate. Taylor often lamented the state of their marriage to other cast members.\n\nIn the days leading up to his death, Russell reportedly broke down and admitted to a friend that reality TV had ruined his life. He expressed concern about a tell-all book that was set to reveal secrets about his sexual preference, including allegations that he was bisexual and had a history of visiting gay websites.\n\nRussell Armstrong leaves behind a daughter, Kennedy, and two sons from previous relationships. The second season of 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' was scheduled to premiere on September 5, but it is unclear if the show will air as planned or if it will be postponed or re-edited in light of Russell's death.\n\nIndustry insiders have suggested that reality TV often presents an inaccurate portrayal of events, with small slights being exaggerated and peacemaking being ignored or left out in the pursuit of a dramatic narrative.

The study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, found that for women with early-stage breast cancer who meet certain criteria (approximately 20% of patients or 40,000 women annually in the U.S.), the removal of cancerous nodes does not improve survival, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or alter the treatment plan. This procedure, which has been performed for over a century, can cause complications such as infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling in the arm.\n\nThe study included 891 patients from 115 medical centers, with a median age in the mid-50s. The women had lumpectomies, and most also received radiation to the entire breast and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both. After the initial node biopsy, the women were randomly assigned to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. The study found no difference in survival between the two groups, with over 90% surviving at least five years, and recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1%.\n\nThe findings are part of a trend towards less radical surgery for breast cancer, as the understanding of the disease evolves. In the past, it was believed that surgery could \"get it all\" and eradicate the cancer before it could spread. However, research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when tumors are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery. The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors and use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.\n\nThe study does not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study. The tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across, and biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else.\n\nDoctors and patients alike may find it difficult to accept less treatment based on the data, but the study's authors believe that the findings should change", "answers": ["A new study has the potential to make breast cancer treatment easier for a sizable number of women, the New York Times reports.

A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

One such invention is a combined grave, coffin, and monument that allows viewing and monitoring of the deceased for a prolonged period. Another invention is a corpse eye closer, a metal device designed to adjust the eyelids of the deceased for a more natural appearance.\n\n3. Graham Hamrick devised a process of embalming that included the use of a burning sulfur torch to preserve bodies for extended periods.\n\n4. James W.

By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans.

Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost annually, according to a study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since 2012 and contributes to a 0.6mm annual rise in global sea levels. The losses are primarily occurring in the West of the continent, where warm waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the land rises due to the ice melting (a process called isostatic readjustment), it can actually constrain ice losses, but only temporarily. Ocean warming is expected to make the ice too thin for this process to help.\n\n3. An international team of ice experts, working with NASA and the European Space Agency, released a study showing that Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992, causing global oceans to rise by about three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). The melting is occurring at an alarming rate, with the continent losing nearly 84 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2011, and over 241 billion tons a year from 2012 to 2017. The study used 24 different methods to measure ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations.\n\nThe melting of Antarctica is a key indicator of climate change and could potentially contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century. The study found that most of the melting is occurring in West Antarctica, where it is in a state of collapse. East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice, but it was gaining ice before 2012. It is unclear whether this trend will continue in East Antarctica.\n\nThe forces driving the ice melt are not expected to improve in a warming climate.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during the Mormon pioneers' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. The photos were unveiled at a news conference in Salt Lake City as part of the church's push to be more transparent and fill a void on the Internet for accurate information about the religion.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a religious text considered sacred by Mormons, and its translation is a significant part of the religion's history.

The translation process is not fully understood, but the church has acknowledged that it was done \"by the gift and power of God.\"\n\nThe Book of Mormon was first published in 1830 and has since been translated into many languages. The translation process is said to have taken place over a short period of time, with Joseph Smith dictating the text from another language. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, which still survives, includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript, and some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English.\n\nThe translation of the Book of Mormon was a significant event in the history of the Mormon religion, and many people played a role in its production. Joseph Smith's scribes, including Oliver Cowdery, worked tirelessly to transcribe the text as dictated by Smith. The task of punctuating the text and setting the type was left to John H. Gilbert, a non-Mormon typesetter who took pride in his work.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has had a significant impact on the Mormon religion and has been translated into over 110 languages.

The article highlights the recent images of a conga line of climbers ascending Everest, which has resulted in at least four deaths this season. Additionally, Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience, one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, decided to cancel his climb and return home due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening climbers, abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face, and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season. The growing number of climbers on Everest, most of them amateurs, and the increasing instability of the high-alpine environment, have raised concerns about managing the mountain's burgeoning popularity and the deteriorating conditions.\n\nThe second story focuses on the risks Sherpas face while helping paying clients ascend Everest. The article reveals that the fatality rate of ethnic Sherpas working on Everest is significantly higher than traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation, and even military combat. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' formula for fatality rates per 100,000 full-time equivalents, the fatality rate for Everest Sherpas from 2000 to 2010 was 1,332, which is much higher than the death rate for miners (25), commercial fishermen (124), Alaskan bush pilots (287), and U.S. military personnel in Iraq from 2003 to 2007 (335). However, since 2010, the number of Sherpa fatalities has risen, with 17 deaths in 2014 alone. The article also mentions that the job has not gotten any safer for Sherpas with the passage of time, with the death rate for climbing Sherpas on Everest from 2004 until now being twelve times higher than the death rate for U.S. military personnel deployed in Iraq from 2003-07.\n\nIn", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The researchers used static facial photographs of 80 men and 80 women and found that people were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men, but not women, based on their facial photographs. The study found that certain facial traits, such as a longer face with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin, were associated with the perception of high intelligence in men. However, these facial traits were not found to correlate with actual intelligence as measured by an IQ test.

The researchers suggest that the ability to accurately assess the intelligence of men from their faces may have important evolutionary consequences. However, they are unsure why this ability does not extend to women, and propose several possible explanations, including the possibility that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic or that women are judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of their intelligence.

If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto was demoted to a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006, in part due to the work of Mike Brown, one of the researchers involved in the discovery of Planet Nine. Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" has been working on this discovery for his daughter, who was upset about Pluto's demotion.\n\nThe researchers have not yet observed Planet Nine directly, but they have used mathematical equations and computer models to infer its existence. They suggest that the planet might have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which is on average 20 times farther away than Neptune. If it exists, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, but at such extreme distances, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would rewrite the textbooks, as it would be the first planet discovered since Neptune in the 19th century. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) would likely evaluate Planet Nine based on the same criteria used to demote Pluto, including whether it \"clears the neighborhood\" around its orbital zone and has the gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects. Brown is confident that Planet Nine meets these criteria.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has reignited the debate over Pluto's planetary status, with some scientists arguing that it should be reinstated. However, Brown argues that those who want Pluto to be a planet are living in the past and should embrace the reality that it is not a planet. He believes that the controversy will gradually die down,", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

Damascus, once known for its vibrant nightlife and all-night party scene, is now a city under siege. War has crept into daily life, with increased checkpoints, violence, kidnappings, and shortages of food, gasoline, and heating oil. Fear and uncertainty are prevalent, with many people avoiding going out after dark. The Opera House, embassies, and even garden parties are no longer a part of daily life.\n\n2. The ongoing battles between rebel and government forces are taking a toll on cities across Syria, with reports of suicide bombings and the establishment of control by the Free Syrian Army in suburbs around Damascus. Some families are keeping their children home from school due to the danger of the commute.\n\n3. The Alawite minority, a key support base for President Bashar al-Assad, is experiencing tension and unease. A shootout between members of the extended Assad family in Qardaha, Assad's ancestral home, and the detention of a prominent Alawite activist have raised concerns about dissent within the Alawite community. While there is no indication that Alawites are switching sides, many are unhappy with Assad's leadership and fear for their future in a post-Assad Syria.\n\n4. The civil war is also affecting Syria's economy, particularly its business elite. Factories have been damaged or destroyed, international sanctions are restricting finances, and fuel shortages are widespread. Many wealthy Syrians have fled abroad, hoping to ride out the turmoil. Despite the economic hardships, Assad has so far been able to keep his head above water with financial support from Iran.\n\n5. Reports suggest that a string of government airstrikes on rebel areas in the country's north have killed at least 20 people and leveled buildings. In response, rebels have blown up two oil and gas pipelines near the Iraqi border.\n\n6. The conflict has resulted in over 33,000 deaths and caused economic losses estimated at nearly $68 billion.

Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports.

The spacecraft, which has been traveling for nine and a half years, will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto, providing the first close-up view of the dwarf planet and its five known moons.\n\nPluto, discovered in 1930, is the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system extending beyond Neptune. It was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to its size and orbit. The New Horizons mission aims to shed light on the origins of the solar system and the Pluto system's formation and evolution.\n\nThe spacecraft has already delivered data that is a \"gift for the ages,\" according to Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator. The data reveals that Pluto is bigger than previously thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles, making it larger than Eris, another Kuiper Belt object. The new size also means that Pluto's interior contains more ice than previously estimated.\n\nNew Horizons has also discovered a hypothesized polar cap on Pluto, which is an ice cap consisting of nitrogen and methane ices. The spacecraft has also picked up signs of nitrogen escaping from Pluto's tenuous atmosphere, which could mean that the nitrogen is fleeing at a higher rate than models have suggested or that the mechanism responsible for triggering the loss is different than anticipated.\n\nThe spacecraft will take hundreds of observations of Pluto and its moons during the flyby, with the first of the highest-resolution images to be released on Wednesday afternoon. The full dataset will take about 16 months to complete, as each piece of data takes about four-and-a-half hours to transmit.\n\nThe Australian Deep Space Communication Complex in Canberra will be the first place in the world to receive the close-up images of Pluto.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time.

Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

A significant contributor to Disney's growth is the success of the film studio, with the park California Adventure being transformed into a Pixar-themed park, with attractions like Cars Land rivaling Toy Story for wait times. To maintain its growth, Disney needs to continue producing films that can provide opportunities for theme park attractions, TV spin-offs, and merchandise.\n\nOn the other hand, the film industry is facing a decline in the production of mid-budget films due to the focus of studios on big-budget films that generate the most revenue. This shift has made it harder for smaller films to be produced, with budgets under $20 million being the norm. This is causing concern for filmmakers like John Waters and David Lynch, who are struggling to secure funding for their films. The decline in mid-budget films is also affecting the careers of many cult and indie stars, with some disappearing from the scene or struggling to maintain a place within it.\n\nThe decline in mid-budget films is due to the high cost of marketing movies, which can be up to 50% of the production budget.

If they were to buy the same home and share it with children, the monthly payment would be $12,177, making it unaffordable even for their combined incomes.\n\nDowning suggests several solutions to increase the housing supply in Palo Alto, such as allowing more floors of housing in mixed-use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, and allowing housing above shops and offices in single-use areas. She also criticizes the city council for prioritizing office development over housing, which exacerbates the jobs-housing imbalance and drives up housing prices.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Palo Alto is not unique, with many other Peninsula towns also refusing to increase housing, leading to a housing shortage in the Bay Area.

The discrepancy between the current expansion rate and predictions based on measurements of the Big Bang afterglow suggests that there may be unknown physical processes at play or that our understanding of the universe is incomplete. The new Hubble constant, calculated at approximately 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, indicates that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years.\n\nThe research team, led by Nobel Laureate Adam Riess, made this discovery by refining the universe's current expansion rate to an uncertainty of only 2.4 percent. They achieved this by developing innovative techniques to improve the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. The team looked for galaxies containing both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae, using the former's pulsation rates to determine their distance and the latter's brightness to measure their true brightness.\n\nThe new value for the Hubble constant is higher than predictions based on observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. This discrepancy could be due to the presence of unknown subatomic particles, an increased power of dark energy, or incompleteness in Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nThe findings could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe, particularly regarding dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, which make up 95 percent of the universe and do not emit light.

This marks the first time since 1986 that the USMNT will not participate in the World Cup. The loss was particularly devastating as the USMNT only needed a draw to secure a spot in the tournament.\n\nThe USMNT's poor performance throughout the qualifying round, which included three wins in ten games, has raised questions about the overall direction of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), the players, and coach Bruce Arena. The loss opened the door for Panama and Honduras, who both needed to win to ensure the USMNT's elimination, which was exactly what happened.\n\nThe USMNT's failure to qualify for the World Cup has been attributed to a variety of factors, including poor tactics, a stale vision, and constant ill-preparedness under former coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who was fired 11 months ago. Current coach Bruce Arena, who was brought in to dig the team out of Klinsmann's hole, has also been criticized for his close-mindedness when it came to squad selection, tactical naivety, and refusal to care about replenishing an aging squad.\n\nThe USMNT's failure to qualify for the World Cup has also been attributed to a broken system in American soccer, including a youth soccer model that requires children to pay to play, which slashes the size of the player pool into a fraction of what it could be. The USMNT's player pool is strong but not nearly what a nation of 325 million should be able to produce. The main reason for this is the youth soccer model that was established in the US decades ago, where talented young players are not given scholarships to soccer academies, and the vast majority of children cannot afford the hefty registration fees and travel-related costs.\n\nThe USMNT's failure to qualify for the World Cup has also been attributed to a lack of investment in youth development by the USSF.

However, the prosecution is likely to portray Rayhons as a sex-hungry man who took advantage of a confused woman who lacked the mental capacity to consent. The case raises complex questions about consent in cases of mental incapacity, particularly in long-term relationships.\n\nIowa law treats spouses differently from others in cases of sexual abuse, with spouses being allowed to engage in sexual activity even if one party is mentally incapacitated, as long as they are cohabiting. However, this provision does not apply to long-term lovers who are not married. The law criminalizes sexual activity with a mentally incapacitated person, physically incapacitated person, or physically helpless person. The prosecution's theory in the Rayhons case is that the spouses were no longer cohabiting, but this distinction is hard to justify.\n\nThe question of how to deal with sex by those who are mentally incapacitated is complex, and it is important to consider the nature of the parties' past relationship. It seems obvious that spouses are entitled to say \"no,\" but it is also reasonable to consider past practice among the parties as evidence of consent in some situations where there is neither a \"yes\" or a \"no.\" This is especially so when the incapacity is permanent or long-lasting.\n\nThe law should be crafted to preclude prosecution in cases where the allegedly injured party does not complain, or where other parties who know do not complain.

The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The US fired 59 Tomahawk missiles from two warships in the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in at least three Syrian soldiers and several civilians being killed. The US President, Donald Trump, stated that the strike was in the \"vital national security interest of the United States.\" Russia, a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, condemned the move as an \"act of aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law.\" Germany and France also blamed Assad for the chemical attack and supported the US response.\n\nThe strike marked a significant policy reversal for the Trump administration, as Trump had previously criticized former President Obama for not taking action against Assad after a similar chemical attack in 2013. However, the move has raised concerns about potential risks for Trump, including the possibility of his gambit with Russian President Vladimir Putin failing, undermining his main goal of defeating the Islamic State, and lack of a clear plan for bringing peace to Syria.\n\nThe strike has also divided Congress, with some senior lawmakers offering support while others raised constitutional concerns about the president's authority to launch military action without congressional approval. Libertarian-minded Republicans, such as Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, criticized Trump for launching the strikes without congressional authorization.\n\nThe Syrian government, which has been under mounting international pressure after the chemical attack, had previously denied responsibility for the attack and blamed opposition fighters for stockpiling the chemicals.

In New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie postponed Halloween until November 5 to ensure public safety and allow for recovery efforts.\n\nThe storm caused multiple fatalities, halted mass transit, and left over 6 million homes and businesses without power. It also caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including flooding, fallen trees, downed power lines, and roadway closures.

Many stores and pumpkin patches closed along the East Coast, and some merchants reported significant losses. The National Retail Federation estimated that the storm would affect Halloween spending, with many consumers having already completed their purchases before the storm.\n\nThe storm also affected fundraisers and other events, with some being postponed or canceled. For example, the Goodwill Gridiron Halloween Party with the Baltimore Ravens was postponed, and the New York Greenwich Village Halloween Parade was expected to have fewer viewers and participants due to the rain.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the storm, some families were able to find creative ways to celebrate Halloween, such as setting up in-home candy hunts or Trunk-or-Treat events in local cul-de-sacs.

The U.S. President Barack Obama has threatened to veto a bill introduced in the Senate that would allow Congress to weigh in on any deal reached with Iran regarding its nuclear capabilities. The bill, known as the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, would require the submission of any agreement within five days of its conclusion and prohibit Obama from suspending or waiving sanctions for 60 days. The White House argues that this legislation could complicate ongoing negotiations with Iran, which are at a crucial stage with a basic framework agreement due by the end of March.\n\n2. Tensions between the United States and Israel have risen ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the U.S. Congress, where he is expected to warn against a potential nuclear deal with Iran. The speech has been controversial, as it was arranged by the Republican party without consulting the White House, and some Democrats have announced they will boycott the speech. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has reiterated Washington's determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, while expressing concern about the politicization of the issue and its potential impact on the U.S.-Israeli relationship.\n\n3. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern over Iran's slow cooperation with its investigation into the Iranian atomic program. The IAEA is investigating two outstanding issues relating to alleged explosives tests and other measures that might have been used for nuclear bomb research. The West fears Iran wants to develop atomic bomb capability, while Tehran maintains its program is for peaceful nuclear energy only. The IAEA is likely to monitor the implementation of any deal between Iran and the six powers (the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia, and Germany) if a deal is reached.\n\n4. The United Nations nuclear watchdog chief, Yukiya Amano, has stated that the inquiry into the Iranian nuclear program cannot continue indefinitely, depending on the level and pace of cooperation from Iran.

The counselors are trained by medical professionals and will also strive to connect women with abortion funds if payment is a barrier to getting an abortion in a clinic.\n2. The project, titled Self-managed Abortion, Safe and Supported (SASS), uses the website abortionpillinfo.org and is modeled after Women Help Women's existing services in other countries. The group will not provide abortion-inducing drugs to women in the US, but will provide information and support to women who have already decided to use the pills. The legal implications of the project are unclear, as the act of seeking information about self-induced abortion is protected by law, but giving out such information could potentially compound the risk of prosecution.\n3. The need for self-induced abortions in the US is a growing concern, as many women may already be taking matters into their own hands due to limited access to abortion services. Studies have shown that many women, particularly those living along the US-Mexico border, are using misoprostol, a drug that can be legally purchased over the counter in many Central American pharmacies, to induce their own abortions. The risks of self-administering abortion drugs without medical supervision include medical complications and potential legal risks.\n4. Another article discusses the experiences of women in the US who are seeking to self-induce abortions due to financial barriers and limited access to abortion services. The article highlights the story of Martina, a woman in Texas who was unable to afford an abortion and turned to the internet for information on how to self-induce an abortion. The article also discusses the history of self-induced abortions in the US and the impact of anti-abortion laws on women's access to safe and legal", "answers": ["A Dutch organization that advises women on reproductive rights has now launched a website to help US women terminate pregnancies on their own. The Guardian reports on the \"Self-Managed Abortion: Safe and Supported\" portal, or SASS, set up by Women Help Women. Through it, 23 trained counselors will answer questions and give advice if women have already decided to take the drug misoprostol. The medication, which, when taken alone or in combination with mifepristone, keeps a pregnancy from happening, is only legal in the US at medical facilities, though it can be purchased OTC in Central American nations. A Women Help Women rep says the idea for the site came about after a Guardian story documenting a Texas woman's trip to Mexico to get the drug, and all the questions she had once she got it. The site won't provide pills, and organizers say they won't even suggest women take them—they're just there to keep women safe if they've already decided to. \"It's worse to just remain silent,\" says a UC San Francisco obstetrics professor who calls misoprostol a \"very safe and effective\" drug (though it's more effective taken with mifepristone, which isn't as easy to obtain). For women who do have complications and must seek medical care, the Washington Post notes they'll be advised that drug-induced and spontaneous abortions typically look the same, and that the drug isn't detectable via drug test. Abortion foes note the meds can be dangerous if not taken correctly or if taken late in the gestation period, and that this site could put women at risk by providing info on taking them.

Walker's decision came after a series of poor debate performances and a decline in support from donors, which led to financial difficulties for his campaign. He encouraged other Republican candidates to consider dropping out as well, in order to focus the race on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner, Donald Trump.\n\nWalker's campaign had been struggling for months, with his poll numbers dropping significantly in both Iowa and nationally. His poll numbers suffered particularly after the first two Republican debates, where he was criticized for his lackluster performances. In a CNN/ORC poll released on Sunday, Walker failed to garner even one-half of 1% nationally among likely GOP primary voters.\n\nWalker's exit from the race comes just ten days after former Texas Governor Rick Perry became the first Republican to drop out of the 2016 race. With Walker's departure, the field now stands at 15 candidates.\n\nWalker's decision to drop out was met with mixed reactions from his fellow Republican candidates. Some, such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, offered kind words and expressed their belief that Walker would continue to fight for conservative principles. Others, such as Donald Trump, simply expressed their condolences and wished him well.\n\nWalker's departure is likely to set off a fierce scramble for his big-money backers, led by the Ricketts family, one of the GOP's most powerful financial contributors. It is not yet clear who Walker's supporters will rally behind, but some have already begun to express their support for candidates such as Rubio, Carly Fiorina, and Ben Carson.\n\nThe exit of Walker and Perry from the race marks the start of a winnowing process in the Republican field, which once numbered 17 candidates.

Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders.

Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports.

The surveillance was part of international electronic monitoring of Donald Trump, his family, and associates for up to a year before he took office.\n\nThe unmasking of these names is controversial as Americans' identities are typically redacted in such reports unless there is a national security, crime, or safety concern.

A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News.

Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials.

The practice of plural marriage resulted in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes, shaped 19th-century Mormon society, and helped create a sense of cohesion among the community.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced incrementally and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. The historical record of early plural marriage is thin due to the lack of detailed records and the unreliability of later reminiscences. The revelation on plural marriage was part of a larger revelation given to Joseph Smith about eternal marriage, which was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children.\n\nJoseph Smith married multiple wives, including some who were already married, and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The exact number of women to whom he was sealed is unknown. The women who united with Joseph Smith in plural marriage risked reputation and self-respect, but many remained faithful Church members and defended both plural marriage and Joseph.\n\nPlural marriage was difficult for Joseph Smith's wife Emma, who opposed the practice. After Emma opposed plural marriage, Joseph may have thought her rejection exempted him from the requirement to gain her consent for additional wives. The decision to accept plural marriage usually came after earnest prayer and intense soul-searching.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was controversial and led to persecution and revilement. In 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage, and after the U.S. Supreme Court found these laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives. In 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, declaring his intention to submit to the laws of the United States and discontinue the practice of plural marriage within the Church.\n\nDespite the end of plural marriage within the Church, the Latter-day Saints continue to honor and respect the faithful pioneers who gave so much for", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

This program was initially introduced by Zappos, an Amazon subsidiary, and has been adapted by Amazon's fulfillment centers. The second program, \"Career Choice,\" offers to pre-pay 95% of tuition for employees who wish to pursue courses in in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon.\n\nAmazon has received significant financial incentives for its operations in Tennessee. The company received $30 million in property tax breaks from three counties for 20 years, and $14.9 million in state grants for infrastructure or job training at its five distribution facilities.\n\nAmazon is also expanding its workforce in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, announcing in January that it will hire 500 more positions.

The studies, conducted by Michael Kasumovic and Jeffrey Kuznekoff, observed the behavior of male players in the video game Halo 3 and found that lower-skilled players were more likely to make hostile comments towards female gamers, while higher-skilled players were more positive towards both male and female players.\n\nThe researchers argue that this behavior is a result of evolutionary competition, with lower-status males feeling threatened by the presence of women in traditionally male-dominated spaces. They suggest that these men use aggression to maintain their social status and suppress the influence of women on the hierarchy. In contrast, higher-skilled players have less to lose and are more likely to support and engage with female players.\n\nThese findings are significant as they provide insight into the factors that contribute to sexist behavior and the individuals who are most likely to exhibit it. The researchers suggest that understanding these factors is crucial for addressing gender inequality and promoting a more inclusive and respectful online environment.\n\nThe studies also highlight the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the factors that affect male hostility towards women. The researchers argue that this perspective can help explain why only a subset of men behave in a sexist manner, and why this behavior is more prevalent in male-dominated spaces.\n\nThe findings are particularly relevant in today's online environment, where harassment is a common issue, especially for women.

A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Another patient, Lazerick Eskridge, suffered severe complications after his transplant, including kidney failure, multiple infections, and an injured diaphragm.\n\nThe articles also discuss the experiences of James \"Lee\" Lewis, who waited years for a new heart and finally received one on the first day of 2018.

Three of the released individuals were part of an illegal procurement network that supplied Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics, which have applications in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.

The budget aims to increase defense spending by $54 billion and offset this by stripping money from more than 18 other agencies. The proposed budget would increase defense spending to fund troop readiness, the fight against Islamic State militants, and procurement of new military equipment. The budget would also make a down payment on a U.S.-Mexico border wall, with an immediate $1.5 billion infusion in the ongoing fiscal year and another $2.6 billion planned for the 2018 budget year.\n\nThe budget proposes significant cuts to various departments, with the biggest losers being Agriculture, Labor, State, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA would see a 31.4% cut, or $2.6 billion, and would eliminate 3,200 jobs. The budget would also eliminate programs such as Obama's Clean Power Plan, which would tighten regulations on emissions from power plants, and popular EPA grants for state and local drinking and wastewater projects would be preserved.\n\nThe budget would also eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, low-income heating assistance, and the AmeriCorps national service program. These programs have been the focus of lengthy battles dating back to the GOP takeover of Congress in 1995 and have survived prior attempts to eliminate them. Lawmakers will have the final say on Trump's proposal in the budget process.\n\nThe budget would also eliminate subsidies for airlines serving rural airports in Trump strongholds and funding for subsidies of Amtrak's money-losing long-distance routes. The National Institutes of Health would absorb a $5.8 billion cut despite Trump's talk in a recent address to Congress of finding \"cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us.\"\n\nThe budget is set to face stiff resistance from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, even from Republicans, whose support is crucial because they must vote to authorize government appropriations.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%.

The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars.

Hunley, which sank an enemy ship during the American Civil War in 1864, has been the subject of a 150-year-old mystery regarding the cause of the death of its eight-man crew. A new study published in the journal Plos One suggests that the crew members died instantly due to the shockwave generated by their own torpedo explosion. The study was conducted by biomechanist Rachel Lance, who built a model of the submarine and subjected it to underwater explosions to simulate the conditions of the attack. The shockwave from the explosion caused the submarine's hull to flex, transmitting a secondary blast wave inside the crew compartment that was of sufficient magnitude to kill the crew members. The study's findings fill a gap in US Civil War history and offer insights into human physiology and the physical forces that can cause injury or death. The study was funded by various organizations, including the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation Endowment Fund at Duke University, the DoD SMART Scholarship Program, and the US Army MURI program. The findings have been met with some skepticism from the Hunley Project, which is responsible for the conservation and research of the original submarine, but Lance believes she has solved a significant part of the mystery.", "answers": ["For more than 150 years, researchers have scratched their heads over a Civil War mystery—and now a Navy engineer says she's solved it. Rachel Lance has been diving deep into the 1864 sinking of the Confederate submarine HL Hunley, which mysteriously went down shortly after sinking the Union's USS Housatonic sloop with a torpedo, reports a Hakai Magazine article posted at Smithsonian.com. Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN.

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that the rate of sea level rise experienced in the 20th century was \"extremely likely\" to have been faster than during nearly the entire period, with the rate of rise accelerating in the 21st century.\n\nThe studies, led by Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, used a combination of geological sea-level indicators from marshes, coral atolls, and archaeological sites around the world, as well as tide-gauge data, to reconstruct sea level changes over the past 3,000 years. The research found that sea level was relatively stable for much of the period, but began to rise significantly in the 19th century, with the rate of rise accelerating in the 20th century.\n\nThe researchers attribute the rise in sea level to global warming, with the burning of fossil fuels for energy producing heat-trapping greenhouse gases that cause glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, and warmer water to expand, taking up more space. The study found that, without human-caused global warming, it is very unlikely that sea levels would have risen as much as they did in the 20th century.\n\nThe research has important implications for coastal communities, as rising sea levels can lead to increased flooding and erosion, and threaten infrastructure and property. The studies also highlight the need for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit future sea level rise and its impacts.\n\nIn addition to the study led by Kopp, another study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the same day found that global sea level could increase by roughly one to four feet by 2100, depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases are released into the atmosphere in the coming decades.

Nassar, who was USA Gymnastics' team doctor for almost two decades, was fired in 2015 and is facing nearly two dozen sexual assault charges against him; he's also set to be sentenced next month on three federal child pornography charges. The multiple lawsuits involving accusations against Nassar name as defendants USA Gymnastics, Michigan State University (where he worked as a doctor for decades), and Nassar himself, among others.

However, Catholic leaders view this as a gift to believers and hope that it will have a positive impact on the faithful.\n\nThe Diocese of Green Bay has been under fire in an abuse-related lawsuit, with allegations of obstructing justice by destroying potentially incriminating files on former priests. The diocese maintains that it has cooperated fully with law enforcement and discarded psychiatric records of deceased priests as required by federal privacy laws.\n\nThe Vatican typically takes a cautious approach to evaluating apparitions, but the church has been using psychiatric examinations and brain scans to assess the mental health of those making claims.

The film is a significant improvement over the last entry, Prometheus, and is considered the most satisfying entry since the first two films in the series. The plot revolves around a spaceship, Covenant, carrying 2,000 human passengers and 1,140 embryos on a long voyage to a distant planet, Origae-6. After a space storm damages the ship's wind sails, the crew discovers a nearby habitable planet, which they decide to explore. However, they soon encounter the terrifying creatures that the 'Alien' series is known for, causing unimaginable mayhem.\n\nThe film explores themes of human life's origins and prospects for survival, with a focus on the contest for dominance between two nearly identical characters played by Fassbender. The writers have made a smart move by building on the only source of vitality in Scott's 2012 film, Prometheus. The film is visually stunning, with superb effects and a lovely score, and creatively, it's a major reset on a level with the series' best.\n\nThe film has been praised for its balance between intelligent speculation, startling action, philosophical considerations, and genre conventions. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more.

It is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide.\n\nThe film tidies up loose ends from Prometheus, making a much better story of the gods vs. men vs. machines ideas that Scott has been exploring for decades. The cast delivers strong performances, with Fassbender's dual role as David and Walter being particularly noteworthy.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fish species, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's blood, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins.\n\nThe studies, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveal that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This means that even during summer warming episodes, the ice crystals do not melt as expected, posing a potential risk to the fish's health.\n\nResearchers found that the ice crystals persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1°C above their expected melting point for at least 24 hours, and at a lower temperature for several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes. Over a long-term record (1999–2012), seawater temperature surpassed the fish's expected melting point in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes.\n\nThe accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins could potentially cause damage, particularly in small capillaries. However, the study suggests that there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation, and further research is needed to understand the long-term cost of having the AFPs and the potential adverse effects on the fish's bodies.\n\nThe findings provide insights into the evolutionary process, demonstrating that every good evolutionary innovation may come with potentially bad or unintended consequences.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has plummeted to its lowest level in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline is causing concern among scientists and environmental groups, who fear that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if the sardines do not recover soon. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may be a factor.\n\nThe PFMC has already slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups argue that the catch should be halted entirely to allow the sardine population to recover. The sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, and history shows that it will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is also causing concern for the health of other marine species. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013. Research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines and instead fed on less nutritious alternatives, leading to malnourished pups.\n\nForage fish, such as sardines, account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 20", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The author criticizes the positive portrayal of Sharon in American and Israeli media, arguing that his actions were far from heroic and that he was responsible for the Lebanon war's catastrophic consequences.\n\nThe second passage, written by Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State, offers a more nuanced view of Sharon's career. Kissinger acknowledges Sharon's role in Israel's wars and his initial reluctance towards peace, but also highlights his later shift towards a vision of coexistence with the Palestinians. Kissinger praises Sharon's decision to withdraw Israeli troops from Gaza and his willingness to cede territory for peace, despite facing opposition from various sides.\n\nBoth passages agree on Sharon's significant impact on the Middle East, particularly in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, they differ in their assessment of Sharon's legacy, with the first passage viewing him as a war criminal responsible for numerous atrocities, and the second passage viewing him as a peacemaker who made significant sacrifices for peace.

The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

It's the final message family and friends received from the couple. After spending the night in Freeport, Sanco and Grant were supposed to fly on to Rum Cay, where they had rented a house, the Bahamas Tribune reports. Simmons says they made a planned stop on the island of North Eleuthera, where they purchased fuel, and departed for the 121-mile flight to Rum Cay.

{"pred": "NASA's Curiosity rover, currently on Mars, has delivered significant findings from its exploration of the red planet. Six papers released by the journal Science detail the rover's discoveries, providing insights into Mars' early epochs, approximately three to four billion years ago. The findings suggest that early Mars was in many ways similar to Earth, potentially supporting microbial life.\n\nOne of the key discoveries is the evidence of an ancient Martian lake, which could have supported life as we know it for long periods, possibly millions of years. This lake, located in Gale Crater, was likely fed by streams originating from mountains and covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide crater. The lake's sedimentary rocks, known as mudstones, contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of the ancient freshwater lake.\n\nThe lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. These microbes are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on Earth.\n\nThe lake is estimated to have existed for at least tens of thousands of years, and possibly much longer. The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis.\n\nCuriosity's mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover's analysis of the mudstones has confirmed and extended its landmark discovery, providing a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago.\n\nWhile Curiosity has not been designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars, the discovery of a potentially habitable environment for chemolithoautotrophs opens up the possibility that life may have existed on Mars in the past. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of the ancient lake, Curiosity has also made progress in its search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds. While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far, their origin remains unclear due to the presence of a chlorine-based compound and an organic solvent that may have contaminated the samples.", "answers": ["The Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of an ancient freshwater lake on Mars that was brimming with the key chemicals necessary to support microbial life, and its findings suggest that it could have held that life more recently than we thought—and possibly for millions of years before that. \"Quite honestly it just looks very Earth-like,\" the Curiosity's lead scientist said, according to Space.com.

{"pred": "In two separate studies, researchers have delved deeper into the life and genetic makeup of Ötzi, the famous Neolithic Iceman discovered in 1991.\n\nFirstly, a study published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences reveals that Ötzi had severe dental issues. His teeth, both front and back, were heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and using them as tools. He also suffered from gum disease and cavities, which may have been caused by his diet rich in whole-grain bread and gruel. The researchers suggest that the increase in starch consumption during the late Stone Age could explain the rising frequency of cavities at that time.\n\nSecondly, an international team has sequenced Ötzi's entire genome, providing new insights into his ancestry and health conditions. The genome analysis reveals that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, a condition associated with risk factors such as being overweight, lack of exercise, smoking, and drinking. However, as a hunter-gatherer, Ötzi did not have these risk factors, suggesting that our understanding of preventing arteriosclerosis may be limited.\n\nThe genome sequencing also places Ötzi in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, indicating that his paternal genes are linked to a population that migrated from the Near East to Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era. This genetic profile suggests that Ötzi is most closely related to small populations living in Sardinia, Corsica, Georgia, and remote areas of Russia.\n\nThe genome analysis also reveals that Ötzi was a carrier of Lyme disease, as the sequencing yielded genes from the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. While it is unclear whether Lyme disease made Ötzi sick during his lifetime, the discovery of 60% of a B. burgdorferi genome from a Neolithic carrier shows that this pathogen has been affecting humans for thousands of years.\n\nFinally, the researchers were able to determine that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was common among Neolithic Europeans.

The snake was first discovered by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936, but subsequent attempts to find more nightsnakes were unsuccessful, and no further sightings were reported over the years.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake was made by a team of researchers led by Daniel Mulcahy from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Juan Martinez Gomez from Mexico's Ecology Institute. They timed their expedition last May to replicate Beebe's steps and used his original field notes as a guide. One of Mulcahy's graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936.\n\nDNA analysis was performed to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and to determine its origin. The tests showed that the Clarion nightsnake is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast, more than 500 miles away. It is believed that the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk that was washed out to sea.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems, and it is now recognized as a full species.

The researchers found that a higher level of potato consumption before pregnancy was associated with a greater risk of developing gestational diabetes during pregnancy.\n\nGestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and can affect both the health of the mother and the baby. Previous studies have linked foods with a high glycemic index, which measures the impact on blood sugar levels, to a higher risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potatoes, being high in carbohydrates, are known to elevate blood sugar levels more than most other foods.\n\nThe studies found that substituting two servings of potatoes per week with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk of developing gestational diabetes by 9-12%. The researchers recommended swapping potatoes with green leafy vegetables and whole grains, which are lower on the glycemic index and have higher levels of healthful nutrients and minerals.\n\nDr. Minisha Sood, director of inpatient diabetes at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, found the study's approach of looking at one high-glycemic food interesting and noted that the findings advocate for a Mediterranean-type diet, which is known to have benefits in terms of weight loss and insulin resistance.\n\nFor those craving potato chips, healthier alternatives such as quinoa chips and lentil chips, which are baked and have less fat, were suggested.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost annually, according to a study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since 2012 and contributes to a 0.6mm annual rise in global sea levels. The losses are primarily occurring in the West of the continent, where warm waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the land rises due to the ice melting (a process called isostatic readjustment), it can actually constrain ice losses, but only temporarily. Ocean warming is expected to make the ice too thin for this process to help.\n\n3. An international team of ice experts, working with NASA and the European Space Agency, released a study showing that Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992, causing global oceans to rise by about three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). The melting is occurring at an alarming rate, with the continent losing nearly 84 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2011, and over 241 billion tons a year from 2012 to 2017.

Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry of the Week calls Corker a hypocrite for his sudden public turn on the president and suggests that the retiring senator is positioning himself to be an \"establishment\" primary challenger to the president in the 2020 election. Now what? James Fallows at the Atlantic writes that if Corker truly believes Trump might blunder his way into World War III, he has an obligation to \"do something about it\" by providing a crucial check on Trump's actions through his position as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. \"Talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts.\" WSJ weighs in: The conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal thinks Corker spoke the truth about the president's \"lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O'Donnell,\" and it hopes other top Republicans follow Corker's lead because it might actually help.

The article highlights the recent images of a conga line of climbers ascending Everest, which has resulted in at least four deaths this season. Additionally, Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience, one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, decided to cancel his climb and return home due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening climbers, abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face, and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season.

The article reveals that the fatality rate of ethnic Sherpas working on Everest is significantly higher than traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation, and even military combat.

However, since 2010, the number of Sherpa fatalities has risen, with 17 deaths in 2014 alone.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The researchers used static facial photographs of 80 men and 80 women and found that people were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men, but not women, based on their facial photographs. The study found that certain facial traits, such as a longer face with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin, were associated with the perception of high intelligence in men. However, these facial traits were not found to correlate with actual intelligence as measured by an IQ test. The study also found no correlation between intelligence and attractiveness or face shape in either men or women. The researchers suggest that the ability to accurately assess the intelligence of men from their faces may have important evolutionary consequences. However, they are unsure why this ability does not extend to women, and propose several possible explanations, including the possibility that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic or that women are judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of their intelligence.

The researchers have not observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the motion of dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto was demoted to a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006, in part due to the work of Mike Brown, one of the researchers involved in the discovery of Planet Nine. Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" has been working on this discovery for his daughter, who was upset about Pluto's demotion.\n\nThe researchers have not yet observed Planet Nine directly, but they have used mathematical equations and computer models to infer its existence. They suggest that the planet might have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which is on average 20 times farther away than Neptune. If it exists, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, but at such extreme distances, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would rewrite the textbooks, as it would be the first planet discovered since Neptune in the 19th century. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) would likely evaluate Planet Nine based on the same criteria used to demote Pluto, including whether it \"clears the neighborhood\" around its orbital zone and has the gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects. Brown is confident that Planet Nine meets these criteria.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has reignited the debate over Pluto's planetary status, with some scientists arguing that it should be reinstated. However, Brown argues that those who want Pluto to be a planet are living in the past and should embrace the reality that it is not a planet.

It was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to its size and orbit. The New Horizons mission aims to shed light on the origins of the solar system and the Pluto system's formation and evolution.\n\nThe spacecraft has already delivered data that is a \"gift for the ages,\" according to Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator. The data reveals that Pluto is bigger than previously thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles, making it larger than Eris, another Kuiper Belt object. The new size also means that Pluto's interior contains more ice than previously estimated.\n\nNew Horizons has also discovered a hypothesized polar cap on Pluto, which is an ice cap consisting of nitrogen and methane ices.

These statements have caused concern among experts and officials, as they contradict longstanding U.S. nonproliferation policy and could potentially violate arms control treaties. Trump's advisers have attempted to clarify his comments, with some suggesting he was referring to modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal rather than increasing its size.\n\n2. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House Press Secretary, had an eventful first day on the job. During an off-air conversation with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, Trump reportedly said, \"Let it be an arms race, we will outmatch them at every pass.

This success is attributed to investments in parks, cruise lines, and Asia, as well as the success of the film studio. The Disney CEO, Robert Iger, expects this growth to continue. A significant contributor to Disney's growth is the success of the film studio, with the park California Adventure being transformed into a Pixar-themed park, with attractions like Cars Land rivaling Toy Story for wait times. To maintain its growth, Disney needs to continue producing films that can provide opportunities for theme park attractions, TV spin-offs, and merchandise.\n\nOn the other hand, the film industry is facing a decline in the production of mid-budget films due to the focus of studios on big-budget films that generate the most revenue. This shift has made it harder for smaller films to be produced, with budgets under $20 million being the norm. This is causing concern for filmmakers like John Waters and David Lynch, who are struggling to secure funding for their films. The decline in mid-budget films is also affecting the careers of many cult and indie stars, with some disappearing from the scene or struggling to maintain a place within it.\n\nThe decline in mid-budget films is due to the high cost of marketing movies, which can be up to 50% of the production budget. Studios are no longer interested in small investments with small returns, preferring to make big-budget films that can generate large returns. This shift has resulted in a decrease in the variety of films being produced, with fewer studios releasing films and a larger share of the market being taken up by a smaller number of films.\n\nThe decline in mid-budget films has led to an increase in the number of films being produced independently, with filmmakers turning to television as an alternative to the big screen. Directors like Cary Fukunaga, Jill Soloway, David Fincher, and Jodie Foster have moved to television, with David Lynch returning to directing for television with Showtime's upcoming Twin Peaks revival. However, television budgets are often scarcely better than those on the indie model, and it is a very different type of storytelling, open-ended, rarely working towards the kind", "answers": ["Wonder what happened to iconic film directors like David Lynch, John Waters, and Francis Ford Coppola?

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan.

The New York Times has a different estimate, citing executives involved in the deal: Olbermann must stay off TV for six to nine months, and can’t talk about his departure, although he can work on the Internet or in radio. His exit comes after years of behind-the-scenes conflict at MSNBC, the Times reports, noting that Jeff Zucker was one step away from firing him during his campaign contributions brouhaha in November. The usually prolific Olbermann has tweeted only once since his departure, and the message—apparently since removed—read “WATCHTHISSPACE MLB.com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14.” Of course, that sparked all sorts of speculation that Olbermann may return to his sports roots. But Olbermann has often promoted his Baseball Nerd blog, Mediaite notes, so the message could mean … nothing. Next up for Olbermann: Writing for TV with Aaron Sorkin?

The discrepancy between the current expansion rate and predictions based on measurements of the Big Bang afterglow suggests that there may be unknown physical processes at play or that our understanding of the universe is incomplete. The new Hubble constant, calculated at approximately 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, indicates that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years.\n\nThe research team, led by Nobel Laureate Adam Riess, made this discovery by refining the universe's current expansion rate to an uncertainty of only 2.4 percent. They achieved this by developing innovative techniques to improve the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. The team looked for galaxies containing both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae, using the former's pulsation rates to determine their distance and the latter's brightness to measure their true brightness.\n\nThe new value for the Hubble constant is higher than predictions based on observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. This discrepancy could be due to the presence of unknown subatomic particles, an increased power of dark energy, or incompleteness in Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nThe findings could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe, particularly regarding dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, which make up 95 percent of the universe and do not emit light. The research is set to be published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. Further studies are ongoing to reduce the margin of error and to better understand the nature of the universe's expansion.", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number—and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo. Part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the \"mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" says another of the project's researchers.

The loss was particularly devastating as the USMNT only needed a draw to secure a spot in the tournament.\n\nThe USMNT's poor performance throughout the qualifying round, which included three wins in ten games, has raised questions about the overall direction of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), the players, and coach Bruce Arena. The loss opened the door for Panama and Honduras, who both needed to win to ensure the USMNT's elimination, which was exactly what happened.\n\nThe USMNT's failure to qualify for the World Cup has been attributed to a variety of factors, including poor tactics, a stale vision, and constant ill-preparedness under former coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who was fired 11 months ago. Current coach Bruce Arena, who was brought in to dig the team out of Klinsmann's hole, has also been criticized for his close-mindedness when it came to squad selection, tactical naivety, and refusal to care about replenishing an aging squad.\n\nThe USMNT's failure to qualify for the World Cup has also been attributed to a broken system in American soccer, including a youth soccer model that requires children to pay to play, which slashes the size of the player pool into a fraction of what it could be. The USMNT's player pool is strong but not nearly what a nation of 325 million should be able to produce.

Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

{"pred": "Henry Rayhons, a former Iowa state legislator, is awaiting trial on a felony charge of raping his wife, Donna Young, who had Alzheimer's disease. The incident allegedly occurred at a nursing home where Donna was living. The couple had been deeply in love, and their families supported their marriage. However, the prosecution is likely to portray Rayhons as a sex-hungry man who took advantage of a confused woman who lacked the mental capacity to consent. The case raises complex questions about consent in cases of mental incapacity, particularly in long-term relationships.\n\nIowa law treats spouses differently from others in cases of sexual abuse, with spouses being allowed to engage in sexual activity even if one party is mentally incapacitated, as long as they are cohabiting. However, this provision does not apply to long-term lovers who are not married. The law criminalizes sexual activity with a mentally incapacitated person, physically incapacitated person, or physically helpless person. The prosecution's theory in the Rayhons case is that the spouses were no longer cohabiting, but this distinction is hard to justify.\n\nThe question of how to deal with sex by those who are mentally incapacitated is complex, and it is important to consider the nature of the parties' past relationship. It seems obvious that spouses are entitled to say \"no,\" but it is also reasonable to consider past practice among the parties as evidence of consent in some situations where there is neither a \"yes\" or a \"no.\" This is especially so when the incapacity is permanent or long-lasting.\n\nThe law should be crafted to preclude prosecution in cases where the allegedly injured party does not complain, or where other parties who know do not complain. However, sometimes third parties might learn of the incident and be upset enough to complain, and a prosecutor might go forward with the case. The law should be crafted to preclude this, as Iowa law does to some extent but not sufficiently.

Despite the Chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from Beijing, sources tell the New York Times. The move lets China save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the New York Times the US government goofed in waiting until Saturday to revoke Snowden's passport, though charges were filed June 14.

Monis had been fighting the validity of the charges, arguing that they infringed on the implied freedom of communication on political and governmental matters in the Commonwealth constitution. The High Court had previously been split three-three on the issue, but refused to hear the case again when Monis' legal team made another bid on Friday.\n\nMonis was known to the Australian police and had a long history of violent crime, including being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife and facing more than 50 sexual and indecent assault charges. He was also convicted for sending abusive letters to families of deceased Australian soldiers. During the siege, Monis sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the Islamic State (ISIL) death cult.\n\nThe siege ended on Tuesday morning after a 16-hour standoff, during which two hostages were killed and four people, including a police officer, were injured.

The animated film Finding Dory continued its success with the biggest third weekend for an animated movie domestically, while The Legend of Tarzan and The BFG underperformed. The BFG, a film adaptation of Roald Dahl's popular children's novel, earned $24 million on a $140 million budget in its North American debut, which is a significant loss. Critics praised Mark Rylance's performance as the Big Friendly Giant, but the movie failed to resonate with audiences, particularly younger ones.\n\nThe BFG's poor performance has sparked discussions about the appeal of children's book adaptations and whether Spielberg's storytelling prowess has diminished. However, it's important to note that the movie's failure might be more about its unremarkable nature rather than a broader trend. The film's title, The BFG, may have been confusing for some audiences, and it seems to have positioned itself at a confusing halfway point between a children's movie and an adults' one.\n\nIn an effort to preserve the integrity of web pages, the Internet Archive is conducting crawls to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages they refer to.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

He gained fame as a member of The Weavers, a group formed in 1948, and continued to perform for six decades.\n\nSeeger was blacklisted by the US Government in the 1950s due to his leftist stance, but he continued to spread his music and ethos through college campuses. He was quizzed by the Un-American Activities Committee in 1955 over his association with Communists, to which he responded, \"I greatly resent the implication that my work makes me any less American.\" He was charged with contempt of Congress, but the sentence was overturned on appeal.\n\nIn 2009, Seeger performed at a gala concert in Washington D.C. ahead of President Obama's inauguration. Obama paid tribute to Seeger, calling him \"America's tuning fork\" and praising his activism.

Many of these women are from the northern provinces of North Korea and live in precarious conditions in rural China, unable to communicate with locals and often shackled inside their homes.\n\nOne woman, Suh, fled North Korea in 2008 and resorted to online sex work after the birth of her second child. She and two other women from her village escaped to Laos and Thailand, leaving behind their children in China. They spoke of their lives in North Korea and China, playing down their experiences out of shame.\n\nAnother group of North Korean women were forcefully repatriated from China after it was discovered they were working as prostitutes on the side while officially employed at a food factory. The women were placed under strict living conditions and were instructed by their handler to engage in prostitution at night.\n\nThe United States has accepted 74 refugees from North Korea since Kim Jong Un took power, but many North Koreans face difficulties in obtaining asylum due to a lack of papers and legal status. The women in this story are currently seeking asylum in the United States, despite the challenges they will face, such as language barriers and lack of support compared to those in South Korea.\n\nThe stories highlight the vulnerability of North Korean women to human trafficking and sexual exploitation, both in North Korea and in neighboring countries. The Chinese government is criticized for not providing legal alternatives to repatriation for North Korean trafficking victims and for prosecuting citizens who assist them. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is barred from access to North Koreans in northeast China, leaving them vulnerable to human traffickers.\n\nThe women's stories serve as a reminder of the hardships faced by North Koreans who seek freedom and a better life, often risking their lives and the lives of their children in the process.

The findings also revealed that those bereaved by suicide were 80% more likely to drop out of education or work, with 8% of the bereaved by suicide having dropped out since the death.\n\nThe study's author, Dr. Alexandra Pitman, emphasized the profound impact suicide can have on friends and family members, but also noted that these outcomes are not inevitable. Dr. Pitman suggested that support is available for those bereaved by suicide and encouraged people to offer practical help and simple gestures to those who have recently experienced such a loss.\n\nThe study also found that those bereaved by suicide tend to perceive more social stigma around the death. When the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared, suggesting that addressing the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement might help limit its impact on people's lives.\n\nDr. Pitman highlighted that people bereaved by suicide should not be made to feel responsible for the death and should be treated with the same compassion as those bereaved by any other cause. She also noted that suicide is a complex issue with no simple explanation, often the result of a culmination of different life events rather than a single cause.\n\nThe study also suggests that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should be considered when assessing suicide risk, in addition to family history. This is because previous studies have shown family history of suicide to be a risk factor for suicide attempt, and risk assessments in hospitals, prisons, and social care settings are designed to take this into account.\n\nThe study was published in the journal BMJ Open.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite.

The summit was preceded by a tweet storm from Trump, in which he denounced critics who said he should not grant Kim a presidential meeting without more North Korean concessions, citing the return of American hostages and a suspension of North Korean nuclear testing as evidence of progress. Trump also tweeted that White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow had suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized.

In 2012, another bailout was undertaken, but the conditions were largely the same.\n\nIn January 2015, a new government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, came into power and sought to renegotiate the terms of the bailout. The government wanted to restore spending cuts, reverse revenue hikes, and obtain debt forgiveness. The creditors, however, have been unwilling to make substantial concessions, leading to a standoff.\n\nOn June 29, Greece defaulted on a key payment to the International Monetary Fund. The European Central Bank then decided it could no longer extend extraordinary lending to Greek banks, leading to their closure and limits on cash withdrawals.\n\nGreece's Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has called on voters to reject the creditors' proposals in a referendum on Sunday.

This practice, though controversial and foreign to many sensibilities, was seen as a commandment from God and was obeyed by some members of the Church. The practice of plural marriage resulted in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes, shaped 19th-century Mormon society, and helped create a sense of cohesion among the community.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced incrementally and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. The historical record of early plural marriage is thin due to the lack of detailed records and the unreliability of later reminiscences. The revelation on plural marriage was part of a larger revelation given to Joseph Smith about eternal marriage, which was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children.\n\nJoseph Smith married multiple wives, including some who were already married, and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The exact number of women to whom he was sealed is unknown. The women who united with Joseph Smith in plural marriage risked reputation and self-respect, but many remained faithful Church members and defended both plural marriage and Joseph.\n\nPlural marriage was difficult for Joseph Smith's wife Emma, who opposed the practice. After Emma opposed plural marriage, Joseph may have thought her rejection exempted him from the requirement to gain her consent for additional wives. The decision to accept plural marriage usually came after earnest prayer and intense soul-searching.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was controversial and led to persecution and revilement. In 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage, and after the U.S. Supreme Court found these laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives. In 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, declaring his intention to submit to the laws of the United States and discontinue the practice of plural marriage within the Church.\n\nDespite the end of plural marriage within the Church, the Latter-day Saints continue to honor and respect the faithful pioneers who gave so much for", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40.

The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

The studies, conducted by Michael Kasumovic and Jeffrey Kuznekoff, observed the behavior of male players in the video game Halo 3 and found that lower-skilled players were more likely to make hostile comments towards female gamers, while higher-skilled players were more positive towards both male and female players.\n\nThe researchers argue that this behavior is a result of evolutionary competition, with lower-status males feeling threatened by the presence of women in traditionally male-dominated spaces. They suggest that these men use aggression to maintain their social status and suppress the influence of women on the hierarchy. In contrast, higher-skilled players have less to lose and are more likely to support and engage with female players.\n\nThese findings are significant as they provide insight into the factors that contribute to sexist behavior and the individuals who are most likely to exhibit it. The researchers suggest that understanding these factors is crucial for addressing gender inequality and promoting a more inclusive and respectful online environment.\n\nThe studies also highlight the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the factors that affect male hostility towards women. The researchers argue that this perspective can help explain why only a subset of men behave in a sexist manner, and why this behavior is more prevalent in male-dominated spaces.\n\nThe findings are particularly relevant in today's online environment, where harassment is a common issue, especially for women.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The power grid breach involved the theft of detailed engineering drawings of power plants and usernames and passwords that could be used to gain access to the operations networks. The hackers were able to remain undetected for an extended period, raising concerns about the vulnerability of the power grid to cyberattacks.\n\nThe power grid is a lucrative target for cyberattacks due to the potential for widespread disruption of electricity supply, which could have serious consequences for the economy and daily life. The grid is aging and outdated, with many substations and equipment lacking adequate network security. The rush to connect smart meters, home appliances, and other devices to the grid has also created new vulnerabilities.\n\nThe U.S. government and energy companies are taking steps to improve cybersecurity, but the extent of the attacks on the grid is not fully known. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation collects information about cyber incidents involving utilities, but the details are often confidential and exempt from disclosure.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

{"pred": "Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Center and American University have discovered that mustached bats, like humans, use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds. This hemispheric specialization for sound processing, where the left brain is better at processing fast sounds and the right processing slow ones, is a trait that has not been observed in any other animal, not even monkeys or apes. This study, published in Frontiers of Neuroscience, suggests that this asymmetrical sound processing in both human and bat brains could provide insights into understanding certain human language disorders and potentially improving computer speech recognition.\n\nThe study's senior author, Stuart Washington, a neuroscientist at Georgetown, explains that this asymmetry in sound processing makes evolutionary sense. In humans, the slower timing of the right hemisphere allows for identifying who is speaking, gauging emotional state via tone-of-voice, and teasing out pitch in music, which is thought to be important for coordinating group activities and forming cultures. For mustached bats, the need for this asymmetry is even more compelling as they rely on the fast timing of the left hemisphere to distinguish communication sounds from each other, and the slow timing of the right hemisphere to use sonar to track the velocity of the fast-moving insects they eat.\n\nInterestingly, this asymmetric sampling in bats is sex-dependent, with males showing more asymmetry than females, which is also consistent with humans. Women tend to use both the left and right hemispheres for language, but men largely use just the left hemisphere. This asymmetric sound processing is the basis for left hemispheric specialization for language, and it is assumed to be more common in men than in women. The results in bats may spur research to confirm this assumption in humans.\n\nOne downside of having such asymmetrical sound processing is that it makes in-depth scientific studies of certain communication disorders, such as aphasia, nearly impossible due to the methods required for these studies often being permitted only in animals. However, with the new understanding of bat sound processing, researchers may be able to conduct this research.\n\nThe study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The authors report having no personal financial interests", "answers": ["Humans were thought to be unique as a species in that we use both halves of our brains to \"distinguish different aspects of sound,\" as Georgetown neuroscientist Stuart Washington puts it.

In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains—the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience. The left is used \"to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because (the bats') communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency.\" All this is more than just a matter of interest: The findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \"can only be permitted in animals,\" Washington adds.

The storm has been described as a \"soggy, record-breaking glimpse of the wet and wild future that global warming could bring\" (Passage 6). Scientists agree that future storms will likely dump more rain than in the past due to warmer air and water, which can hold more moisture. The warmer seas, which fuel hurricanes, were also warmer than normal during Harvey.\n\nThere is ongoing debate among climate scientists about the role of global warming in causing or exacerbating the storm. Some scientists suggest that climate change may have contributed to the storm's intensity and stalling, while others argue that natural variability is the primary factor.\n\nThe news articles also touch on the political response to the storm, with some outlets criticizing CNN for discussing the potential role of climate change in the storm's intensity. Fox News, in particular, has been accused of politicizing the storm by using it to advance a political narrative and dismissing the role of climate change.\n\nIn addition to the immediate impact of the storm, the articles also discuss the long-term implications of climate change for future storms. Scientists warn that as the climate continues to warm, we can expect to see more intense and frequent storms, with potentially catastrophic consequences.\n\nOverall, the news articles highlight the complex and ongoing debate about the role of climate change in extreme weather events, as well as the political response to such events.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The new, more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right. They could also reveal the DNA is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer, and merely the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" per the Camera.

The charges were filed against six current and former employees from two state departments, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).\n\nThe DHHS employees, Nancy Peeler, Robert Scott, and Corrine Miller, are accused of burying a report showing a significant year-over-year spike in blood lead levels in Flint children and preventing action to alert top state health officials and the public.

Some argue that her comments are unprecedented and unethical, while others believe she is warning against a potential threat to the republic. The comments have also set a precedent for other justices with strong political inclinations, and have led to calls for recusal in cases involving Trump. Trump has responded by calling on Ginsburg to resign, stating that her comments were \"very dumb\" and \"disgraceful.\" The Code of Conduct for United States Judges prohibits judges from publicly endorsing or opposing a candidate for public office, and Ginsburg's comments have been criticized for violating this rule. The comments have also raised concerns about the independence of the judiciary and the appearance of impartiality.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics.

But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Hunley, which sank an enemy ship during the American Civil War in 1864, has been the subject of a 150-year-old mystery regarding the cause of the death of its eight-man crew. A new study published in the journal Plos One suggests that the crew members died instantly due to the shockwave generated by their own torpedo explosion. The study was conducted by biomechanist Rachel Lance, who built a model of the submarine and subjected it to underwater explosions to simulate the conditions of the attack. The shockwave from the explosion caused the submarine's hull to flex, transmitting a secondary blast wave inside the crew compartment that was of sufficient magnitude to kill the crew members. The study's findings fill a gap in US Civil War history and offer insights into human physiology and the physical forces that can cause injury or death. The study was funded by various organizations, including the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation Endowment Fund at Duke University, the DoD SMART Scholarship Program, and the US Army MURI program. The findings have been met with some skepticism from the Hunley Project, which is responsible for the conservation and research of the original submarine, but Lance believes she has solved a significant part of the mystery.", "answers": ["For more than 150 years, researchers have scratched their heads over a Civil War mystery—and now a Navy engineer says she's solved it. Rachel Lance has been diving deep into the 1864 sinking of the Confederate submarine HL Hunley, which mysteriously went down shortly after sinking the Union's USS Housatonic sloop with a torpedo, reports a Hakai Magazine article posted at Smithsonian.com. Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN.

The research found that sea level was relatively stable for much of the period, but began to rise significantly in the 19th century, with the rate of rise accelerating in the 20th century.\n\nThe researchers attribute the rise in sea level to global warming, with the burning of fossil fuels for energy producing heat-trapping greenhouse gases that cause glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, and warmer water to expand, taking up more space. The study found that, without human-caused global warming, it is very unlikely that sea levels would have risen as much as they did in the 20th century.\n\nThe research has important implications for coastal communities, as rising sea levels can lead to increased flooding and erosion, and threaten infrastructure and property. The studies also highlight the need for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit future sea level rise and its impacts.\n\nIn addition to the study led by Kopp, another study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the same day found that global sea level could increase by roughly one to four feet by 2100, depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases are released into the atmosphere in the coming decades.

The proposed plan would offer a comprehensive set of benefits, including hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, prescription drugs, vision, and dental care. The plan is more generous than the single-payer plans run by America's peer countries, such as Canada and the Netherlands.\n\nThe bill has garnered support from several Democratic senators, including Kirsten Gillibrand, Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. The senators argue that the current health care system is unaffordable and that the average family would benefit financially under the plan due to the elimination of private insurance costs.\n\nHowever, the bill does not provide details on how it would be financed, and it is unclear who would pay more for their coverage and by how much. The bill's financing options will be released later this week. The bill's introduction comes after the party's all-hands fight to preserve Obamacare, and it offers a blueprint for fundamentally reshaping the American health care system by moving towards a government-run, single-payer program.\n\nThe bill calls for the elimination of premiums for private health insurance, deductibles, and co-pays.

Seriously. The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The gap between CEO and worker pay has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, with the ratio peaking in 2000 at 344 to 1. The rise in CEO pay cannot be entirely explained by stock market growth or corporate profits, as CEO compensation has outstripped both over the past 40 years.\n\nThe report also highlighted the impact of CEO pay on workers further down the corporate ladder. EPI claims that the redistribution of wages to the top 1% has affected the wage growth of the bottom 90%. If the redistribution of wages had not occurred, the wages of the bottom 90% could have grown twice as fast as they actually did.\n\nIn a separate development, it was reported that there were abnormalities in the fair value measure of stock awarded under plan-based awards in 2017. This caused the average CEO compensation to artificially fall by nearly $2 million due to missing data for the \"fair value\" of stock awarded under plan-based awards (stock_awards_fv).

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life.

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

{"pred": "A series of studies suggest that older fathers may have \"geekier\" sons, as indicated by higher non-verbal IQ, increased focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness. The study, conducted by researchers from King's College London and the University of Southern California, analyzed data from over 15,000 twins and found a positive correlation between the age of the father and the geekiness of the sons. The study, published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, indicates that there may be evolutionary advantages for men having children later in life.\n\nThe researchers created a \"geek index\" to measure the geekiness of the children, which included scores for non-verbal IQ, focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness. The geek index was found to be predictive of future academic achievement, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The study found that the geek effect was more pronounced in boys and that the age of the mother had no impact.\n\nThe study suggests that the geek effect may be due to characteristics of the fathers themselves, as men who delay fatherhood often do so due to extended career and educational pursuits and likely display higher levels of \"geekiness.\" The study also suggests that some of the genes relating to geekiness and autism may overlap, and that these genes may be more prevalent in older fathers. This could explain why the geek effect was only seen in boys, as females may be protected from autism in general.\n\nThe study does not suggest that men should delay having children until they are older in the hope of having more intelligent sons. The researchers caution that the findings should not be used to guide individual decisions about parenthood. The study does not extend beyond secondary education and future success, and it remains possible that personality traits associated with the geek index may cease to be advantageous in later life.\n\nThe study also raises questions about the link between autism and advanced paternal age. The researchers were not able to measure the link directly, but suggest that it could be explained by new mutations in sperm that affect development. The study suggests that when a child is born with only some of these genes, they may be more likely to succeed in school, but with a higher \"dose\" of these genes, they may be more at risk of autism", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
