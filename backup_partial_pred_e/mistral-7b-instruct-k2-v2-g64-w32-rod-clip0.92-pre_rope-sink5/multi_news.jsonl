He was particularly known for his support of African-American causes, providing funding for the building of over 5,300 schools in the rural South, and supporting the careers of prominent African-American artists.\n\nIn the documentary \"Rosenwald,\" directed by Aviva Kempner, the little-known story of Rosenwald's impact on African-American culture and education is explored. The film features interviews with notable African-Americans like Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, all of whom attended Rosenwald schools. The documentary also delves into the parallels Rosenwald drew between the violence against blacks in America and the pogroms against Jews in Europe, and his influence from Booker T.

Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest.

The government is facing criticism for missing signs that could have prevented the attack, but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles stated that it is impossible to control everyone in a free society. The suspects were filmed by a passerby, with Adebolajo stating that they carried out the attack because British soldiers kill Muslims every day. The suspects were shot by armed police and are currently under armed guard in separate London hospitals in stable conditions.\n\nThe killing of Drummer Rigby has led to a prayer service in his hometown of Middleton, Greater Manchester, and calls for residents to fly union jacks. Drummer Rigby served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus and was a drummer, a role that allows them to be deployed anywhere in the world within 24 hours. The former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, Richard Barrett, stated that it is hard to detect attacks of this type due to the suspects having no overseas connections or broader connections in the UK.\n\nThe Daily Mirror obtained video footage showing the moment police shot Adebolajo and Adebowale. The footage shows the suspects setting up an ambush bid to murder the first police officers to arrive, with Adebolajo charging at police officers and Adebowale aiming a gun at them. The suspects had lured police to the scene by dragging the body of the murdered soldier into the middle of the road.

The current state of women's representation in top corporate positions is dismal, with women making up only a small percentage of CEOs, executive officers, and board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo address this issue, it is suggested that companies should introduce girls to female role models, clearly explain the requirements and rewards of leadership, and provide proactive efforts to groom female talent throughout the year. Introducing girls to high-level women in the company can make a significant impact, as it allows them to see successful women in action.\n\nMoreover, understanding the day-to-day responsibilities of leadership can help girls make informed decisions about their own careers. Hearing directly from both male and female leaders about their experiences can help close the gap in girls' comfort levels with leadership.\n\nPrinceton University's proactive approach to encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes and visible leadership roles serves as an example of the impact that proactive efforts can have.\n\nIn addition, sponsorship initiatives, where influential individuals provide opportunities and support to their protégés, are crucial for diversity in the corporate world.

{"pred": "In the frigid waters of Antarctica, a unique species of fish known as notothenioids have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in their icy environment. These proteins prevent the freezing of their blood and tissues, but a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has revealed a paradoxical trade-off: the same AFPs that inhibit ice growth also inhibit ice melting, leading to the accumulation of internal ice crystals.\n\nThe research, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals in the fish's body, altering their surface and making it difficult for them to melt, even at temperatures above the freezing point. This superheated ice persists inside the fish for extended periods, potentially causing long-term damage.\n\nThe team discovered this phenomenon through a combination of lab experiments and field observations. In the lab, they heated fish to temperatures that would normally melt the ice, but it remained intact. They also analyzed temperature data from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and found that the water temperature rarely exceeded the point at which the ice in the fish's body would melt.\n\nThe accumulation of ice crystals inside the fish's body could potentially pose a risk, as it may obstruct blood flow and cause problems in the fish's capillaries. However, the exact consequences of this phenomenon are still unknown. The team speculates that the spleen, which has a high concentration of ice crystals, may serve as a filter to remove the ice crystals from the bloodstream.\n\nThe discovery of this superheating effect in notothenioid fish provides a fascinating insight into the complexities of evolution. Every adaptive trait comes with a trade-off, and the AFPs that help these fish survive in their icy environment also contribute to the lifelong accumulation of internal ice crystals. This study underscores the ongoing process of evolution, where each step forward often comes with a step back. The team's findings could also have implications for our understanding of other species and their adaptations to extreme environments.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

{"pred": "The West Coast of North America is experiencing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that supports a diverse marine ecosystem. This decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, and overfishing. The decline in sardine population is causing concern for various species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that rely on sardines as a major food source.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth more when left in the water due to their value as food for commercially important predators.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is also affecting local fishermen, with many reporting a significant drop in catches. The Eileen, a sardine fishing boat, returned empty-handed after spending $1,000 on fuel. The sardine crash has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists warn that the effects could be felt for years if sardines do not recover soon.\n\nThe reasons for the drop in sardine population are unclear, but the decline is the steepest since the mid-20th century. If the sardines do not recover, experts warn that the West Coast's marine ecosystem and local fishermen could suffer for years. The Pacific sardine is known for its wildly unpredictable population swings, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment.\n\nResearchers are also studying the impact of the sardine decline on ocean predators, with evidence suggesting that some species are struggling to find food. The scarcity of prey is thought to be the leading cause behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

The film, which premieres this week, has been criticized for its portrayal of racial stereotypes and homophobic humor. During a Q&A session, audience members voiced concerns about the film's depiction of African-Americans and its treatment of homosexuality.\n\nThe film's comedy, according to critics, relies heavily on Ferrell's character's fears of being raped in prison, including a scene where he attempts to have oral sex with a gay man in a bathroom stall. Critics argue that this portrayal is outdated and offensive, with The Guardian and Variety labeling it as one of the ugliest gay-panic humor in recent studio releases.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Ferrell, Hart, and the film's producers have defended the film as a satire of stereotypes, not a representation of them.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts conducted a study to estimate the extent of inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings, including doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics.\n\nThe study found that approximately 13% of all outpatient visits in the U.S., or about 154 million visits annually, result in an antibiotic prescription. However, about 30% of these prescriptions are unnecessary, translating to around 47 million unnecessary prescriptions each year. The majority of these prescriptions are for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe study also found that 44% of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinusitis, middle ear infections, pharyngitis, and pneumonia. Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because they are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe study highlights the need for improving antibiotic prescribing practices to prevent the further development of drug-resistant bacteria, which could render antibiotics ineffective for treating life-threatening infections. The CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts have outlined strategies for health care providers, patients, and the health care industry to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, including evaluating prescribing habits, implementing stewardship activities, and providing education to patients about the proper use of antibiotics.\n\nThe White House has also set a goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar systems produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3 to 7pm) compared to south-facing panels. West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity use during peak demand by 65%, while south-facing panels reduced it by 54%.\n\nThe study's findings could significantly impact the residential solar market, as homeowners with west-facing roofs, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar, may now find their west-facing roofs to be a better location for solar panels. This could encourage more homeowners to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nThe study's results are noteworthy because they show that west-facing panels are more effective during peak demand hours, which coincide with increased home usage and utility demand. West-facing panels also reduce the amount of electricity that goes unused and sent back to the grid, making it easier for utility companies to manage high levels of electricity.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's unclear how the results would change during winter months when the sun sets earlier. Additionally, the study has not been publicly released, and some utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule for solar panels.\n\nThe study's findings are not the first to suggest that west-facing solar systems are more effective. A 2011 study by the California Public Utility Commission also found that west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones.\n\nThe potential benefits of adjusting solar panel orientation vary depending on the region, and the structure of incentives provided by utility companies also plays a role in how consumers choose to orient their panels.

However, as a hunter-gatherer, Ötzi did not have these risk factors, suggesting that our understanding of the preventability of arteriosclerosis may be limited.\n\nThe genome sequencing also placed Ötzi in the G2A4 haplogroup, which indicates that his paternal genes originated from a population that migrated from the Near East to Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era.

President Barack Obama has ordered the creation of a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks, as outlined in a top-secret presidential directive, known as Presidential Policy Directive 20. The directive, which was issued in October 2012, details the use of Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO) and the potential consequences of such actions. The aim of the directive is to provide a framework for the government to make decisions on cyber actions, taking into account factors such as effectiveness, risk, and international law. The directive also includes provisions for the potential use of cyber actions inside the US, but only with the prior approval of the president.\n\n2. The Obama administration has been refining its use of offensive cyber operations to combat electronic assaults against the US. Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, stated that the directive signed by President Obama calls for government cyber tools to be integrated with other national security tools. The White House released a declassified summary of the directive in January, which stated that the US shall undertake the least action necessary to mitigate threats and that network defense and law enforcement are preferred courses of action.\n\n3. The news comes as President Obama was about to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with cybersecurity being one of the main topics of discussion. The Guardian's report on the directive was published just before the meeting, which took place at the Sunnylands estate in California. The leaders had \"more extensive discussions\" on cybersecurity during the meeting, with both leaders acknowledging the need for further talks.\n\n4. The US and China have had contentious bilateral issues, including cyberespionage, North Korea's nuclear program, Beijing's maritime disputes in Asia, and Chinese market reforms. The leaders agreed to work together on cybersecurity and improve military-to-military relations. They also discussed the need to institutionalize and regularize military-to-military talks that have often been suspended in the past.\n\n5.

The leaders will have six hours of talks, a private dinner, and walks around the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage to try to achieve it. As the summit opened this evening, Obama said he hoped it would establish a \"new model of cooperation\" between the nations, and Xi used the phrase \"a new model of major country relations,\" reports Politico.

The study, which involved 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer, found that for women who meet certain criteria (approximately 20% of patients, or 40,000 women in the U.S. annually), the removal of cancerous lymph nodes does not improve survival rates, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or prevent the disease from spreading. The study's findings are significant because the removal of lymph nodes has been a standard practice for over a century, with the belief that it helps prevent cancer spread.\n\nThe study's results are particularly relevant for women with early-stage breast cancer who have undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as these treatments likely eliminate any disease in the nodes. The researchers noted that the removal of cancerous lymph nodes can lead to complications such as infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling in the arm that can range from mild to disabling.\n\nThe study's findings, combined with similar results from earlier studies, are expected to change medical practice for many patients. However, the shift may take time as the belief in removing nodes is deeply ingrained.

By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans.

{"pred": "In the news, there are three main stories about Antarctica's rapidly increasing ice melt and its impact on global sea levels.\n\n1. Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost each year, according to a new study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since 2012 and contributes to a rise in global sea levels by 0.6mm annually. The losses are predominantly occurring in the West Antarctica region, where warm ocean waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. The study, which incorporates data from 24 independent satellite assessments, indicates that Antarctica is becoming a significant contributor to sea-level rise.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the ice melts, the bedrock may lift up, potentially slowing the ice loss. However, this process is likely to be too slow to counteract the melting that has already occurred.\n\n3. The latest assessment of Antarctica's ice loss shows a significant increase compared to the previous assessment in 2012. The new assessment sees the contribution of Antarctica to global sea-level rise tracking the upper end of projections made by computer simulations of possible future sea levels. The study suggests that sea levels are likely to rise by 50-60cm by 2100, which will have significant impacts on coastal communities and the frequency of major storms and flooding events.\n\nThese news stories highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctica's ice loss as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal communities.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The pictures were unveiled at a news conference in Salt Lake City, and the stone is described as dark brown with swirls, and believed to have been made by one of Smith's wives, Emma Smith. The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during the Mormon pioneers' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a religious text considered sacred by Mormons, believed to have been translated from gold plates using the stone and other tools. The translation process is a topic of interest, with some details known but not fully understood. The translation is said to have taken place over a short period, with Joseph Smith dictating the text to scribes. The original manuscript, which still survives, suggests that the text was dictated from another language, as it contains errors and grammatical constructions more characteristic of Near Eastern languages.\n\nThe translation process involved physical instruments, including a clear pair of stones known as the Urim and Thummim, and a smaller, oval stone known as a seer stone.

The Gold Butte National Monument, near Las Vegas, protects a scenic and ecologically fragile area that includes rock art, fossils, and dinosaur tracks.\n\nIn response to these designations, President Donald Trump, in his first days in office, reduced the size of both monuments significantly. The Bears Ears National Monument was reduced by 80%, and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was reduced by 45%. These actions were met with harsh criticism from environmental groups, Native American tribes, and outdoor companies such as Patagonia, who argue that the President does not have the authority to undo previous monument designations and that the move jeopardizes Native American artifacts, dinosaur fossils, and other natural wonders.\n\nPatagonia, in particular, has taken a strong stance against the Trump administration's actions, filing a lawsuit to block the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument and replacing its homepage with a stark message, \"The President Stole Your Land.\" The company argues that the move is illegal and represents the largest elimination of protected land in American history. In response, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called Patagonia's claims \"nefarious, false, and a lie.\"\n\nIn addition to Patagonia, a coalition of five tribes, including the Navajo Nation, has also filed a lawsuit to challenge the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument. The tribes argue that the President does not have the authority to downsize a monument and that the land is sacred to them. Two lawsuits have also been filed to try to block the reduction of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\n\nThe court cases are likely to drag on for years, and it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration's actions will stand.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands.

{"pred": "In the news, there are two main stories revolving around Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain. The first story discusses the ongoing problems with overcrowding, unstable weather, and geography on Everest, which have led to multiple deaths and near-misses this season. The overcrowding is due to the increasing popularity of the mountain, with hundreds of climbers attempting to reach the summit each year. One of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, Himalayan Experience (Himex), decided to cancel their climb this season due to unstable conditions, including warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, and a massive serac threatening the trail. Despite Himex's departure, over 700 climbers remain on the south side of the mountain, with a total of 11 deaths reported so far this season.\n\nThe second story focuses on the risks and dangers faced by Sherpas, the ethnic group who make up a significant portion of the climbing staff on Everest. A 2013 article by Grayson Schaffer revealed that the fatality rate for Sherpas on Everest is much higher than that of other traditionally dangerous professions such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation, and military combat. The fatality rate for Sherpas on Everest from 2000 to 2010 was 1,332 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalents, compared to 25 deaths per 100,000 for miners, 124 for commercial fishermen, 287 for Alaskan bush pilots, and 335 for U.S. military personnel in Iraq from 2003 to 2007. However, since 2010, the number of Sherpa deaths on Everest has increased significantly, with 4,053 deaths from 2010 to 2014. The most recent tragedy occurred on April 18, 2018, when an avalanche struck climbers in the Khumbu Icefall, killing 16 Sherpas and three members of other ethnic groups.\n\nThe risks faced by Sherpas are due to a variety of factors, including the heavy loads they carry, their lack of access to medical care and equipment,", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing their faces, but not women.

However, these facial traits were not correlated with actual IQ scores. The researchers suggest that the ability to accurately assess the intelligence of men may have important evolutionary consequences, but the reasons for this ability are still unclear. One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces.

The situation is being described as extremely serious, with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission expressing concern.\n\nEfforts are being made to restore power to the plant and re-establish cooling systems, but it is uncertain if these efforts will be successful. Helicopters, fire trucks, and water cannons have been used to spray water on the reactors, but the effectiveness of these methods is questionable.

The researchers have not yet directly observed the planet, but have inferred its existence from the motion of smaller objects in the outer solar system. If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the solar system's models and potentially rewrite the textbooks.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine comes after a decade of controversy surrounding Pluto's status as a planet. In 2006, Pluto was demoted from its status as the ninth planet due to the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto. The demotion was led by Mike Brown, who has since been referred to as the \"Pluto killer.\" Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, initially set out to disprove the existence of a ninth planet, but their research led them to conclude that the best explanation for the clustering of smaller objects in the outer solar system is the gravitational effects of a much larger object.\n\nBrown and Batygin's research builds on earlier work by Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo, who suggested the possibility of a ninth planet in 2014. The existence of Planet Nine would explain the peculiar clustering of small, icy objects in the outer solar system and would require a reevaluation of the solar system's models.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant milestone in astronomy and could potentially be confirmed within the next few years. The search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on multiple continents searching for the elusive planet. If Planet Nine is found, it would be the first planet discovered since Neptune in the 19th century.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would also have implications for the definition of a planet. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) demoted Pluto from planet status in 2006 due to its small size and the presence of other similar objects in the outer solar system. If Planet Nine is found to meet the IAU's criteria for a planet, it would be classified as such", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

Damascus, the capital of Syria, is experiencing a significant transformation due to the escalating war. The city, once known for its vibrant nightlife and all-night party scene, is now a city under siege, with increased military presence, frequent suicide bombings, and a growing fear of kidnappings. The city's infrastructure is strained, with shortages of gasoline, food, and heating oil, and roads being closed at a moment's notice. The once-unshakable support for President Bashar al-Assad among Damascus residents is waning, with discussions turning to the city's deteriorating conditions and the increasing likelihood of a violent future.\n\n2. The ongoing battles between government forces and rebels are taking a heavy toll on cities across Syria. The fighting has led to the destruction of oil and gas pipelines, causing further economic hardship. The conflict has also resulted in the death of at least 20 people in Idlib and Aleppo provinces, according to activist reports.\n\n3. The Alawite minority, a key support base for President al-Assad, is facing challenges within their own community. Tensions are rising within Syria's Alawite community, with rumors of unease within the Assad family and the detention of prominent Alawite activists. The Alawites, who have historically been oppressed by the Sunni majority, fear for their future in a post-Assad Syria. Some Alawites are questioning their loyalty to the regime, expressing frustration with the violence and the exploitation of their fears by the government.\n\n4. The civil war is also impacting Syria's economy, with many businesses suffering from damage, sanctions, and distribution problems. Wealthy Syrians, who have traditionally supported President al-Assad, are seeing their businesses struggle due to the conflict. Factories have been burned down or damaged, and international sanctions are restricting their finances. The economy has been heavily impacted, with inflation rising, the currency dropping, and economic losses estimated at nearly half of the country's gross domestic product.

Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports.

After a nine-year, 3 billion mile journey from Earth, the spacecraft will approach Pluto at 7:49 a.m. EDT, coming within 7,500 miles of its surface. The flyby will provide the first high-resolution images and data about Pluto, its moons, and its atmosphere.\n\nNew Horizons has already delivered preliminary data, revealing that Pluto is larger than previously thought, measuring 2,370 kilometers in diameter. This means it contains more ice and less rock than expected beneath its surface. The spacecraft has also detected methane and nitrogen ice in Pluto's polar cap.\n\nThe flyby will also provide insights into the solar system's early history, as Pluto is located in the Kuiper Belt, a region believed to contain important clues about the formation of the solar system. The mission could help refine theories about how water spread through the solar system, how life began on Earth, and the atmospheric processes on other planets.\n\nThe flyby is a significant milestone in space exploration, as it completes the exploration of the \"classical\" nine planets in the solar system. New Horizons will take hundreds of observations during its close encounter, with the first images expected to be released on Wednesday. However, due to the distance, it will take 16 months for all the data to be transmitted back to Earth.\n\nThere is a small risk of the spacecraft colliding with dust particles during the flyby, which could be catastrophic. The mission team has been surveying the system for any potential hazards.\n\nThe flyby coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first ever flyby of Mars by the Mariner 4 probe.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

The success of these attractions has led Disney to invest further in parks, cruise lines, and Asia, expecting these investments to continue generating profits.\n\nThe success of Disney's theme park attractions is due to the company's focus on creating immersive experiences based on popular films. For example, California Adventure, which initially struggled to attract visitors, has been transformed into a Pixar-themed park, with attractions like Cars Land rivaling the wait times of Toy Story Mania.\n\nHowever, the focus on big-budget films and theme park attractions has made it difficult for studios like Disney to justify smaller, mid-budget films. This trend is not unique to Disney, as other studios are also focusing on large investments in blockbuster films to generate maximum revenue.\n\nJohn Waters, a filmmaker whose last movie was released a decade ago, recently shared his struggle to secure funding for a new film.

Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom.

One possibility is that the new calculations are inaccurate, but if they are correct, they could suggest that the universe is expanding at a faster pace due to the influence of dark energy or the presence of unknown subatomic particles traveling close to the speed of light. Another possibility is that Einstein's theory of relativity may be inaccurate.\n\nThe research was conducted by a team led by Adam Riess, a Nobel laureate astronomer, and involved the use of Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae to refine the distance measurements to distant galaxies.

{"pred": "In the news, Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom faced a no-confidence vote from her Conservative party on Wednesday, following the submission of 48 letters from party members triggering the vote. The vote was a result of growing discontent among Conservative lawmakers over May's handling of Brexit, particularly her Brexit deal with the European Union (EU) which has been met with opposition from both pro-Brexit and pro-EU factions within the party. The vote took place in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster, with May receiving 200 votes in support and 117 votes against, indicating a bitterly divided Conservative party.\n\nMay's Brexit deal, which was agreed after two years of negotiations, was designed to maintain close ties with the EU post-Brexit. However, the deal has been met with criticism from both sides, with pro-Brexit factions viewing it as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result, and pro-EU factions fearing it will weaken the West and harm the UK's economy. May had previously cancelled a parliamentary vote on the deal, scheduled for Tuesday, due to the likelihood of a heavy defeat.\n\nThe outcome of the vote will shape the course of Brexit, with potential consequences for the unity of the UK, the future of the UK's economy, and the status of London as a global financial center. If May wins the vote, she can remain as leader for another year, but will face continued challenges in getting her Brexit deal through parliament. If she loses, she must step down and a new Conservative leader will be chosen, potentially leading to a delay or even halt in Brexit.\n\nThe outcome of the vote will also have implications for the EU, with the EU expressing a commitment to an orderly British withdrawal, but refusing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. The EU has also been accelerating its no-deal Brexit planning in response to the political turmoil in the UK.\n\nThe vote comes at a critical time for the UK, with Brexit scheduled for March 29, 2019.

The event aims to bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions to improve the design and technology of breast pumps. The goal is to make pumping less awkward, more efficient, and more user-friendly.\n\nThe current breast pump design has several problems, including a loud motor, multiple parts that are hard to clean, the inability to lay down while pumping, difficulty keeping track of pumped milk, and a lack of private spaces to pump. Additionally, people are often uncomfortable with breastmilk and breastfeeding, which can make pumping in public or at work awkward.\n\nThe hackathon is being organized by a group of MIT Media Lab students and researchers who are parents and have had bad experiences with breast pumps. They believe that maternal health is a field that has lagged behind and want to improve the breast pump to make it easier for working mothers to breastfeed their babies.\n\nAt the hackathon, teams will work on ideas such as smarter interfaces, guided experiences, data collection, and hands-free compression technology. Some potential innovations include a breast pump that mimics the way a baby sucks, a wearable, hands-free pump, and a pump that interfaces with a smartphone.\n\nThe hackathon is free to attend, but registration is required as space is limited. The event will take place at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The winning team will receive a prize of $3,000 and a trip to Silicon Valley to pitch their idea to investors.\n\nThe breast pump is seen as a symbol of a technology that could be vastly improved to save lives, save money, and lead to healthier and happier families. The event aims to make space for innovation in family life more broadly and support a wide variety of projects. The breast pump is also seen as a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum, as women are forced to use a loud, embarrassing device to balance work and breastfeeding.\n\nIn addition to the hackathon, there is a call for ideas for improving the breast pump, and donations of old breast pumps are", "answers": ["It might not be the first thing that comes to mind after the word \"hackathon,\" but organizers of an upcoming one at MIT say the world is long overdue for a better breast pump.

{"pred": "On December 15, 2014, Man Haron Monis, a self-proclaimed Islamic cleric with a history of criminal charges, took 17 hostages during a siege at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place. The siege began shortly after the High Court rejected Monis' last-ditch appeal against his conviction for sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Monis had been granted political asylum in Australia in 2001 and had a violent criminal history, including charges for being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, multiple sexual and indecent assault charges, and sending abusive letters to families of deceased Australian soldiers. The siege ended on December 16, 2014, after a 16-hour standoff, resulting in the deaths of two hostages and Monis himself. The victims were Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson. The siege led to questions about why Monis was not on a terror watch list and how he was able to obtain a gun despite his criminal history. An investigation was launched into the police operation and the motives of Monis. The incident sparked a wave of condolences and tributes, with people leaving flowers and signing condolence books in memory of the victims. The Australian National Imams Council issued a statement expressing their condolences and urging against violence and recrimination. The incident was a reminder of the growing concern over lone wolf attacks and the need for authorities to prioritize suspects in an age of \"lone wolf\" attacks.", "answers": ["As Australia mourns two hostages killed in a Sydney cafe yesterday, many are wondering what gunman Man Haron Monis was doing on the streets in the first place.

The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

The funding was supposed to be transferred by January 1st but was withheld due to the Trump administration's review of U.S. aid to the Palestinians. The funding freeze is seen as a response to the Palestinian Authority's suspension of contacts with the Trump administration following the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Western diplomats believe that the funding cut could lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, and Lebanon. Israeli security officials are also concerned about the potential escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The accident occurred on a high-speed track, with the train derailing just outside the station and crashing into a concrete wall. The driver, Francisco Jose Garzon Amo, who had boasted about speeding on Facebook, is under investigation for causing the accident due to allegedly traveling at over twice the speed limit, which was 80 kph on that stretch of track. The driver, who suffered minor injuries, was taken to the hospital and is under police guard.

{"pred": "In this summary, we will discuss the underperformance of the movie adaptation of Roald Dahl's \"The BFG\" at the box office during the Independence Day weekend. The film, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Disney, had a budget of $140 million but earned only $22 million domestically, with expectations of a total domestic gross of $55-$65 million. This is a significant disappointment for Spielberg, as it marks one of his rare box office flops, particularly since \"The BFG\" was intended as a commercial crowd-pleaser rather than a historical drama.\n\nThe film's poor performance can be attributed to several factors. First, it was released during a crowded summer season with numerous other high-profile films, such as \"Finding Dory\" and \"The Legend of Tarzan.\" Second, the title \"The BFG\" may have been confusing to audiences, as the acronym is not immediately recognizable. Third, the film lacked recognizable stars, with Mark Rylance, while an award-winning actor, not being a box office draw. Fourth, the giant character in the film may have appeared more scary than friendly, which may have deterred families from attending. Lastly, the film's budget of $140 million was a risky proposition, given the relatively low popularity of Roald Dahl's books compared to J.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series.\n\nSpielberg's previous films have generally been successful, with only a few exceptions such as \"Hook\" and \"The Adventures of Tintin.\" However, these films were not intended as commercial crowd-pleasers like \"The BFG.\" This is a rare instance where Spielberg's film was intended as a blockbuster but failed to deliver, which may indicate a shift in audience preferences or a decline in Spielberg's box office appeal.\n\nThe film's poor performance may also signal a change in the film industry, as the creator of the modern blockbuster now struggles to keep the adult-skewing, star-driven drama relevant. It remains to be seen if \"The BFG\" will be a one-time flop or a sign of a larger trend in the industry. Despite the film's underperformance, Spielberg has other projects in the pipeline, including \"Ready Player One,\"", "answers": ["With a $140 million budget and an opening weekend take of only $24 million, The BFG is poised to be Steven Spielberg's biggest flop in 37 years, Rolling Stone reports. That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

This increased risk brings the absolute risk up to 1 in 10. Additionally, those bereaved by suicide are 80% more likely to drop out of education or work. The study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council, surveyed 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had experienced sudden bereavement. The results of the study were published in BMJ Open.\n\nThe study's findings highlight the significant impact that suicide can have on friends and family members. However, the outcomes are not inevitable, and the authors emphasize that support is available for those affected by suicide bereavement. The study also found that people bereaved by suicide tend to perceive more social stigma around the death. When the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared, suggesting that addressing the stigma attached to suicide bereavement may help to limit its impact on people's lives.\n\nThe authors of the study recommend that people bereaved by suicide should not be made to feel responsible for the death and should be treated with the same compassion as those bereaved by any other cause. They also suggest that asking about the impact of a suicidal loss, including a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends, should be considered when assessing suicide risk. This is because a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should also be considered as a risk factor for suicide attempt.\n\nThe study's findings are particularly relevant for employers, who should be aware of the significant impact that suicide bereavement can have on their employees' working lives.

They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65% more likely to attempt suicide themselves (what NDTV refers to as the phenomenon of \"suicide contagion\") than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes—or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release.

This merger was confirmed by Jabhat al-Nusra's leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, although he claimed he was not consulted about the announcement. The merger was initially kept secret to allow Syrians to judge Jabhat al-Nusra independently, without the bias of its ties to Al Qaeda. Jabhat al-Nusra is considered the most effective and disciplined rebel formation in the Syrian civil war, and its merger with Al Qaeda is a cause for concern due to its potential to establish a long-term safe haven for the group, which could lead to future attacks on the West.\n\nThe Obama administration has designated Jabhat al-Nusra a terrorist organization due to its links with Al Qaeda. The merger announcement may complicate the arming of Syrian rebels by Gulf powers, as there are fears that weapons intended for more secular rebel groups could fall into the hands of Jabhat al-Nusra and other jihadist groups. The Syrian government has seized on the merger announcement to reinforce its propaganda that the rebellion is a foreign conspiracy relying on terrorists and foreign Jihadist fighters.\n\nThe merger may also have implications for the broader Syrian conflict, as it could lead to increased cooperation between Al Qaeda in Iraq and Jabhat al-Nusra, which has already shown increasing cooperation in recent months.

The website provides instructions for self-administering misoprostol, but also informs women of the legal risks involved. The legal implications of the project are unclear, as the act of seeking information about self-induced abortion is protected by law, but the actual administration of misoprostol carries potential legal and medical risks.\n\nResearch suggests that a small but significant number of US women attempt to induce their own abortions without medical supervision, particularly those living along the US-Mexico border.

He encouraged other candidates to follow suit, suggesting that a smaller field would allow for a more focused and positive conservative message to emerge. Walker's exit marks the second major departure from the Republican presidential race, following former Texas Governor Rick Perry's withdrawal earlier in September.\n\nWalker's campaign had initially gained momentum due to his success in battling public unions in his home state, but his poll numbers began to plummet as Donald Trump rose as the front-runner. Walker struggled to articulate his positions on key issues, particularly birthright citizenship, and his campaign was unable to keep up with the financial demands of a presidential run.\n\nIn the wake of Walker's departure, other campaigns began to poach his staff and donors.

Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders.

Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border.

The political landscape is divided, with the Democratic bloc being slightly larger and growing at a faster rate, giving Clinton a presumptive advantage. The Emerging Democratic Majority theory, which argues that Democrats have built a presidential majority, is supported by a Pew survey that shows no significant change in public opinion between 2012 and 2014. Skepticism towards the theory is based on the belief that the 2014 midterm elections were a sign of a resurgent Republican coalition.\n\nHowever, the survey by Pew shows that there was no major change in public opinion, but rather a shift in who showed up to vote. Another point of contention is the millennial voters, with some arguing that they are turning towards the Republican Party. However, a recent Pew survey shows that younger millennials lean Democratic at nearly the same rate as older ones.\n\nClinton's personal popularity is also a topic of discussion, with some believing that her personal unpopularity will hold her back. However, her personal unfavorability is not as severe as that of potential Republican candidates, particularly Jeb Bush.\n\nAnother factor is the current state of the economy, which is on a course to leave the incumbent party in a stronger position. The public's satisfaction with the Democratic policy direction is also a factor, with President Obama's job approval rating recovering since the midterm elections.\n\nThe possibility of voter exhaustion, where voters grow increasingly restless with the incumbent party after a second term, is also a concern.

Hyde-Smith, a former state lawmaker, faced Democrat Mike Espy, who would have been the first black senator from Mississippi since the Reconstruction era. The election was marked by controversy surrounding Hyde-Smith's comments about attending a \"public hanging\" if invited, which many saw as racially insensitive given Mississippi's history of lynchings.\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign was heavily supported by President Donald Trump, who held two rallies in the state on Monday to boost her chances. Trump praised Hyde-Smith in a tweet after the race was called, saying he was \"very proud\" of her. Hyde-Smith thanked Trump for his support in her victory speech.\n\nEspy, a former agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton, campaigned as a moderate who would work with Republicans to benefit the state. He tried to energize black voters, particularly women, and win over white swing voters. However, he was unable to overcome the Republican advantage in the state, where 38% of the population is black.\n\nHyde-Smith's comments about a \"public hanging\" and her support for Confederate symbols and Confederate artifacts were criticized by many, including several businesses that demanded their donations to her campaign be returned. Hyde-Smith initially refused to apologize for the comments, but later said she was sorry \"for anyone that was offended.\"\n\nThe election was seen as a test of whether Hyde-Smith's comments would lead to a surge in black turnout and a potential upset, similar to the victory of Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama's special Senate election last year. However, the state's history of voting Republican and its conservative leanings ultimately proved too much for Espy to overcome.\n\nThe runoff was necessary because neither Hyde-Smith nor Espy gained more than 50% of the vote in the initial special election in November, which was held to fill the seat vacated by longtime Republican Senator Thad Cochran, who resigned due to health concerns.

Plural marriage, the practice of one man being married to multiple women, was commanded by God through prophets, including Joseph Smith, the founder of the LDS Church. This practice was introduced incrementally and was kept confidential by participants, as it was foreign to the sensibilities of many Latter-day Saints and provoked controversy and opposition.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was first commanded to Joseph Smith in 1831, but it was not widely taught or practiced until the Church moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. Joseph Smith married multiple wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to do the same. The practice was seen as a means to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant and to create and strengthen a sense of cohesion among Latter-day Saints.\n\nPlural marriage was a challenging aspect of the Restoration, testing the faith of those who practiced it. Some Latter-day Saints experienced powerful spiritual experiences that helped them accept and obey this commandment. However, the practice was also controversial and led to persecution and revilement.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was publicly acknowledged in Utah between 1852 and 1890, but it was not universally practiced. Most plural families consisted of two wives and two husbands, and divorce was available to women who were unhappy in their marriages. The practice declined over time, and in 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued a statement known as the Manifesto, which declared the Church's intention to submit to the anti-polygamy laws of the United States and to cease the practice of plural marriage.\n\nThe Church's role in plural marriage continued to be a subject of debate, particularly after Reed Smoot, an Apostle, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. In 1904, Church President Joseph F. Smith issued a statement known as the Second Manifesto, making new plural marriages punishable by excommunication.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

This behavior was found to be a response to the perceived threat of a hierarchical reorganization due to the entry of a female competitor, as lower-status males have the most to lose in terms of their social standing and access to potential mates.

This finding is significant because it indicates that e-cigarettes may be serving as a gateway to traditional tobacco use.\n\nAnother study found that adolescents who use e-cigarettes are six times more likely to initiate cigarette smoking within a year compared to those who have never used e-cigarettes. This suggests that e-cigarettes may be a high-tech way to hook a new generation on nicotine, potentially leading to lifelong addiction and health problems.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently taken jurisdiction over e-cigarettes, but it will be years before any regulations are put into effect.

It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10540}

Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright—founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo—blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $60 million in Bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million Bitcoins worth $605 million—the same amount attributed to Nakamoto. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" Wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day Newsweek claimed American Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's inventor.

{"pred": "The news summarized in the provided passages revolves around the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which has caused extensive flooding in Houston, Texas. The news articles discuss the impact of climate change on the storm, the political implications of the disaster, and the role of partisan politics in the coverage of the event.\n\n1. Hurricane Harvey: The news reports detail the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey, which has resulted in record-breaking rainfall and flooding in Houston. The storm has caused significant damage and displacement, with estimates suggesting that it has dumped about 1 million gallons of water for every man, woman, and child in southeastern Texas.\n\n2. Climate Change and Hurricane Harvey: While scientists are still conducting studies to determine the exact role of climate change in the storm, they agree that future hurricanes will likely be wetter and more intense due to warmer air and water. The increased moisture in the air is attributed to global warming, as warmer air can hold more water vapor. Additionally, warmer ocean temperatures provide more fuel for hurricanes.\n\n3. Political Implications: The news passages discuss the role of politics in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Some articles highlight the partisan divide in the response to the storm, with some politicians using the disaster to advance their political agendas. For example, Fox News was criticized for politicizing the storm by attacking CNN's coverage of climate change.\n\n4. Funding and Politics: The news also touches on the issue of funding for disaster relief. The passages mention past disputes over funding for disaster recovery, with some politicians advocating for offsetting aid with spending cuts in other programs. This has been a contentious issue in the past, with debates over funding for relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy.\n\n5. Role of Media: The news passages also discuss the role of media in covering natural disasters. Some articles argue that the media should provide important facts and context during a crisis, while others caution against politicizing the coverage. The articles highlight the importance of balanced and informed reporting during times of crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the news passages discuss the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey, the role of climate change in intensifying future storms, the political implications of the disaster, the funding challenges for disaster relief, and the importance of balanced and informed media coverage during times", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

The allegations span various stages of Cosby's career, from his early days as a rising star in Hollywood to his later years as a respected elder statesman of the entertainment industry. The women's stories share similar patterns, including Cosby offering drugs, resistance from the women, and lifelong trauma. Cosby's team has issued statements denying the allegations and questioning the credibility of the accusers.\n\nCosby's scheduled appearance on David Letterman's show was cancelled, and he has been dropped by several other projects, including a comedy special on Netflix and reruns of \"The Cosby Show\" on TV Land. The scandal has also affected Cosby's personal life, with his wife, Camille, speaking out in defense of her husband.\n\nIn addition to the sexual assault allegations, Cosby's wild and largely forgotten days in Hollywood have also been highlighted. During this time, Cosby was known for his parties and his close relationship with Hugh Hefner. He co-owned a restaurant and was a regular at Playboy's mansion.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby represent a significant shift in perceptions, as the 1960s were a time when such behavior was less likely to be publicly condemned. The story has been covered by multiple news outlets, including The Washington Post, which interviewed five of the women who have come forward with allegations against Cosby. The Post also reviewed court records that shed light on the allegations made by a former director of women's basketball operations at Temple University.\n\nThe scandal has had a significant impact on Cosby's career and legacy, with many questioning whether he will ever be able to recover from the allegations.

The spacecraft will be equipped with advanced technology to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit and intense solar radiation. The mission aims to investigate the origins of solar wind, the mysterious heating of the sun's atmosphere, and how solar wind accelerates to such high speeds.\n\nThe renaming of the mission is a tribute to Parker's groundbreaking work in solar astrophysics, as he first proposed the existence of solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will carry a chip with pictures of Parker and his papers, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice. Parker, who will turn 90 on June 10, was also awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest award from the space agency for non-governmental personnel.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is not the first mission to be named after a scientist, as Nasa has previously renamed missions to honor Enrico Fermi and James Van Allen. The mission is expected to offer unprecedented insights into the physics of the sun and could radically change our understanding of the sun and its effects on space weather.\n\nThe mission's findings could have significant implications for understanding the physics of stars and space weather, which can impact satellites, astronauts, and even the power grid and radiation exposure on airline flights. The cost of the mission is estimated to be around $1.5 billion. The stakes are high, as a major solar event without warning could cause $2 trillion in damage in the United States and potentially leave parts of the country without power for a year.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be the first mission to explore the sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, and will provide valuable data to improve space weather forecasting and protect our technological society from the effects of solar storms.

The study was conducted by biomechanist Rachel Lance, who designed a model of the submarine and set off test explosions to simulate the blast. The shockwave transmitted through the submarine's thin hull and caused fatal injuries to the crew, particularly to their lungs. This theory contradicts previous theories that the crew drowned or suffocated, or were killed by gunfire from the enemy ship. The findings of the study have not been universally accepted, as the Hunley Project, a team of researchers and scientists at Clemson University, has not yet endorsed the theory. The study adds to our understanding of the physical forces that can cause injury and death in underwater explosions, and offers insights into the vulnerabilities of the human body to such forces.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

{"pred": "Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, is introducing a bill on Wednesday to establish a single-payer health care system in the United States, known as \"Medicare for All.\" The bill aims to provide comprehensive health care coverage to all Americans, including hospital visits, doctor visits, substance abuse treatment, dental, vision, and reproductive care, among others. The bill also proposes a four-year transition period to phase out private insurance and employer-sponsored health plans.\n\nThe bill has garnered support from several Democratic senators, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Kamala Harris. The bill's introduction comes after the recent fight to preserve the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in the Senate.\n\nThe bill faces significant legislative obstacles, as it is unlikely to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. However, the concept of single-payer health care is gaining traction among the public, with 53% of Americans supporting a national health care plan, according to a June poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe bill has been criticized for not addressing the financial mechanics required to implement such a massive program, and the financial impact on taxpayers and businesses is unclear. The bill proposes funding the program in part through a 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers, and further tax hikes on the wealthy.\n\nThe bill's introduction has been met with enthusiasm from single-payer advocates, particularly from the progressive grassroots movement that supported Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign. However, some Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, Sherrod Brown, Dianne Feinstein, and Tim Kaine, have not yet announced their support for the bill.", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

Seriously. The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The lawsuit, filed by Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield, Calif., on behalf of what the suit says could be millions of consumers, claims Spin Master ran \"a bait-and-switch marketing scheme.\" Hatchimals are plush animals stuffed into plastic eggs that, when the egg is rubbed and cuddled for about half an hour, should begin to peck their way out.

The report also suggests that the Santa Maria could be buried under coastal sediment in marshland near the small town of En Bas Saline, Haiti.\n\nThe Unesco report has implications for the US's relationship with the organization, as the US has refused to pay its financial contribution to Unesco for the past three years and was stripped of its voting rights last year.

This decision was made after a meeting with founder Hugh Hefner and other executives, acknowledging that the internet has made nudity outdated and commercially less viable.\n\nThe magazine will still feature women in provocative poses, similar to other men's magazines like Maxim, Esquire, GQ, and Vice.

The magazine aims to appeal to a broader and younger audience by covering up nude photos. However, this move may alienate its long-time subscriber base, as suggested by Samir Husni, director of Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi.\n\nPlayboy has been a significant cultural and political platform, hosting interviews with influential figures such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Jimmy Carter, Miles Davis, Vladimir Nabokov, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

{"pred": "In the frigid waters of Antarctica, a unique species of fish known as notothenioids have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in their icy environment. These proteins prevent the freezing of their blood and tissues, but a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has revealed a paradoxical trade-off: the same AFPs that inhibit ice growth also inhibit ice melting, leading to the accumulation of internal ice crystals.\n\nThe research, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals in the fish's body, altering their surface and making it difficult for them to melt, even at temperatures above the freezing point. This superheated ice persists inside the fish for extended periods, potentially causing long-term damage.\n\nThe team discovered this phenomenon through a combination of lab experiments and field observations. In the lab, they heated fish to temperatures that would normally melt the ice, but it remained intact. They also analyzed temperature data from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and found that the ice crystals did not melt at their expected melting point of around 30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe accumulation of ice crystals inside the fish's body could potentially pose a risk, as it may obstruct blood flow and cause problems in other parts of the body. However, the exact consequences are still unknown, and it's possible that the fish have evolved other mechanisms to deal with this issue.\n\nThe discovery of this potentially harmful side effect of the AFPs adds to our understanding of the evolutionary process. As Cziko explains, \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and one step back.\" This research highlights the importance of studying not only the benefits of adaptive traits but also their potential drawbacks.\n\nThe study sheds light on the unique adaptations of notothenioids, which are the dominant fish species in the Southern Ocean and can survive in seawater as low as 29 degrees Fahrenheit. Understanding these adaptations could help scientists better understand the survival strategies of other species living in extreme environments.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

At the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley, archaeologists from the Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School have found a stone tool buried 12 feet below the surface, beneath a layer of volcanic ash dated to 15,800 years ago from the Mount St. Helens eruption. This tool, a hand-held scraper made from orange agate, could be up to 15,800 years old, making it older than any known site of human occupation in western North America and predating the Clovis culture, which was previously believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America.\n\nThe tool was found near an ancient streambed and a rock shelter where people regularly built fires and possibly lived for a long time, as indicated by the presence of camel teeth and stone projectile points. The scraper was used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and potentially carving wood, and a blood residue analysis revealed it contained proteins consistent with bison.\n\nThe discovery has been met with skepticism from the scientific community, as no break in the ash layer has been found that could confirm the tool was not moved down from higher up. Two pre-Clovis sites, Paisley Cave in Oregon and Monte Verde in Chile, are currently the only widely accepted pre-Clovis sites. If the Rimrock Draw site holds up to scrutiny, it would push back the date of human occupation in the western United States by about 1,500 years, to the end of the Pleistocene era when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses, and bison roamed the area.\n\nThe excavation at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter will continue this summer, with the hope of finding more evidence to support the claim that the site is older than the Clovis culture.

This decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, and overfishing. The decline in sardine population is causing concern for various species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that rely on sardines as a major food source.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth more when left in the water due to their value as food for commercially important predators.\n\nThe decline in sardine population has also affected commercial fishing, with fishermen experiencing steep cuts in the amount they are allowed to catch. The sardine fishing boat Eileen, for example, returned to port without a single fish after spending $1,000 worth of fuel. The decline in sardine population is also causing concern for the region's marine mammals, seabirds, and other predators that rely on sardines for food.\n\nScientists are still debating the causes of the sardine decline, with some suggesting that overfishing may have played a role. However, the decline is being compared to the mid-20th century sardine collapse, and if sardines do not recover soon, experts warn that the West Coast's marine ecosystem could suffer for years. The decline in sardine population is also being linked to the scarcity of prey, with sea lion mothers feeding on less nutritious food sources such as market squid, rockfish, and hake, leading to malnourished sea lion pups washing up on beaches.\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in Pacific sardine population is causing concern for the West Coast ecosystem, commercial fishing, and various", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same.

This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions such as colds, flu, bronchitis, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nThe study found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the U.S. result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions being for acute respiratory conditions. Half of these prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions were deemed unnecessary. The study also highlighted that health professionals often prescribe antibiotics due to patient pressure and the perceived demand for antibiotics, despite understanding when antibiotics are not needed.\n\nThe CDC and Pew's reports emphasize the importance of reducing unnecessary antibiotic use to prevent the further development of drug-resistant bacteria, known as superbugs.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar systems produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3 to 7pm) compared to south-facing panels. West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity use from the grid by 65% during peak demand, while south-facing panels reduced usage by 54%.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels are more effective because they capture more solar energy in the afternoon, a time when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, and when utility companies experience peak demand. This could have significant implications for homeowners and utility companies, as it could lead to reduced peak demand on the grid and less strain on utility companies during peak hours.\n\nThe study's findings are not the first to suggest that west-facing solar panels may be more effective. A 2011 study by the California Public Utility Commission also found that west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields.\n\nHowever, utility companies in the United States, including Southern California Edison, continue to recommend a south orientation for solar panels.

The study, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, provides new insights into Ötzi's dental health, genetic makeup, and potential diet.\n\nÖtzi, who lived around 5300 years ago, suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, according to a 3D computer tomography examination of his teeth. His teeth were worn down from grinding coarse grains and using as tools, and the high starch content in his diet, likely from whole-grain bread or gruel, is believed to be the cause of his dental problems.\n\nIn addition to the dental examination, an international team has sequenced Ötzi's entire genome. This analysis reveals that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, a condition associated with risk factors such as being overweight, lack of exercise, smoking, or drinking. Surprisingly, as a hunter-gatherer, Ötzi had none of these risk factors. This suggests that our understanding of the causes of arteriosclerosis may be incomplete.\n\nThe genome sequencing also revealed that Ötzi belonged to the G2A4 haplogroup, a rare paternal lineage that originated in the Near East and migrated to Europe around 1000 years before Ötzi lived. This finding places Ötzi's genetic profile closest to the populations of Sardinia, Corsica, and remote areas of Georgia and Russia.\n\nThe genome analysis also confirmed that Ötzi was a carrier of Lyme disease, as evidenced by the discovery of 60% of the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium genome in his remains. While it is unknown if Ötzi suffered from Lyme disease during his lifetime, the discovery of this pathogen in a Neolithic individual shows that Lyme disease has been affecting humans for thousands of years.\n\nThe new findings add to our understanding of Neolithic life and provide a valuable resource for future research.

The study, which involved 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer, found that for women who meet certain criteria (approximately 20% of patients, or 40,000 women annually in the U.S.), the removal of cancerous lymph nodes does not improve survival rates, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or prevent the disease from spreading. The study's findings are significant because the removal of lymph nodes has been a standard practice for over a century, with the belief that it would prevent cancer spread. However, the new research suggests that chemotherapy and radiation therapy are sufficient for treating microscopic disease in the lymph nodes.\n\nThe study's results, combined with findings from earlier studies, are expected to change medical practice for many patients.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tons of ice being lost each year since 1992, according to a study published in the journal Nature. This has resulted in a 0.6mm annual increase in global sea levels, a three-fold increase since 2012. The majority of the melting is occurring in the West Antarctica region, where warm ocean waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. The East Antarctica region is showing some growth, but it is relatively small and cannot counterbalance the losses in West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in the journal Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the ice sheet thins, the bedrock may lift up, potentially slowing the ice loss. However, this process is expected to be slow and may not be fast enough to stop the ice loss caused by current warming trends.\n\n3. The latest assessment of Antarctica's contribution to global sea-level rise shows it tracking at the upper end of projections made by computer simulations of possible future sea levels. The assessment suggests that by 2100, the sea level rise could be 50-60cm, which would have significant impacts on coastal communities and the frequency of major storms and flooding events.\n\nThese findings highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctica's ice loss as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal communities.

The Wall Street Journal takes a closer look at the company's \"elusive\" (and apparently reticent) founder. \"Evan doesn't talk much,\" shrugs an early investor. The company's plans for the future are an important piece of the IPO puzzle. Sources tell the New York Times those plans may involve a drone. Despite Snapchat's sluggish user growth and the company's hefty hosting costs, Mad Money's Jim Cramer believes the trade will be a \"phenomenal\" one. \"I think the good absolutely outweighs the bad here,\" he says, per CNBC.

The Bears Ears National Monument covers 1.35 million acres in the Four Corners region and is home to over 100,000 archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings. The designation was met with opposition from state Republican leaders and rural residents who argue it will add another layer of federal control and restrict energy development. The Gold Butte National Monument, near Las Vegas, protects rock art, artifacts, and dinosaur tracks.\n\nIn response to these designations, President Donald Trump, in his first days in office, reduced the size of both monuments significantly. The Bears Ears National Monument was reduced by 85%, and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was reduced by 45%. These actions were met with harsh criticism from environmental groups, tribal leaders, and outdoor companies like Patagonia, who argue that Trump does not have the authority to undo previous monument designations and that the reductions jeopardize important cultural and natural resources.\n\nPatagonia, in particular, has taken legal action against Trump's decision, filing a lawsuit to challenge the reductions. The company argues that the President's actions are illegal and that the Bears Ears National Monument is crucial for protecting sacred tribal lands. Other groups, including a coalition of five tribes, have also filed lawsuits to preserve the Bears Ears National Monument.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the reductions are necessary to reverse federal overreach and to promote energy development in the affected areas. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has defended the reductions, stating that the lands targeted by Trump remain protected because they are still under federal control.\n\nThe legal battles over these national monuments are expected to continue for years, with both sides vowing to fight for their respective positions.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources.

At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter.

The first story discusses the ongoing problems with overcrowding, unstable weather, and geography on Everest, which have led to multiple deaths and near-misses this season. The overcrowding is due to the increasing popularity of the mountain, with hundreds of climbers attempting to reach the summit each year. One of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, Himalayan Experience (Himex), decided to cancel their climb this season due to unstable conditions, including warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, and a massive serac threatening the climbing route. Despite the cancellation, Himex's decision was criticized by many, and the remaining climbers continue to face risks, with the death toll currently at 11, with more climbers preparing to make a summit bid.\n\nThe second story focuses on the risks faced by Sherpas, the ethnic group who make up a significant portion of the climbing staff on Everest. According to a study, the death rate for climbing Sherpas on Everest is much higher than for traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation, and military combat. Despite the risks, Sherpas continue to work on the mountain due to the financial incentives, with many earning between two and eight thousand dollars for their work. However, the death rate for Sherpas has been increasing in recent years, with the worst three-year period in Everest's history occurring between 2014 and 2016. The most recent tragedy, an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall, resulted in the deaths of 16 Sherpas, making it the worst climbing accident in Everest's history. The Sherpas have demanded better compensation and benefits from the Nepali government and guiding companies, and have threatened to go on strike if their demands are not met.\n\nOverall, the news highlights the dangers and risks associated with climbing Mount Everest, particularly for Sherpas, and the ongoing efforts to manage the growing number of climbers and ensure the safety of all those involved.", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

{"pred": "A study published in the journal PLoS One has found that people can accurately predict the intelligence of men based on their facial features, but not women. The researchers, from the Czech Republic, used static facial photographs of 80 university students (40 men and 40 women) to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing their facial photographs. The study revealed that faces perceived as highly intelligent are prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. Conversely, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer together, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin.\n\nHowever, the researchers found no correlation between these facial traits and actual IQ scores, either in men or women. They also found no relationship between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape. The study suggests that people can accurately judge intelligence from faces of men, but not women, based on visual cues that are not based on facial shape. The researchers propose that one possible explanation for this is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces. Another possibility is that women are judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of their intelligence.\n\nThe study also found that two factors of general intelligence, fluid intelligence and figural intelligence, showed a significant relationship with perceived intelligence from men's faces. Fluid intelligence is the capacity to logically solve problems independent of acquired knowledge, while figural intelligence describes the ability to handle objects such as images, patterns, and shapes. The researchers suggest that these findings may have important evolutionary consequences, as the ability to accurately assess intelligence could be an indicator of underlying genetic fitness.\n\nThe study was conducted by Karel Kleisner, Veronika Chvátalová, and Jaroslav Flegr from Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.

Renée Cross, senior director for the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, tells the Texas Tribune that the numbers are \"very impressive.\" \"We see so much anger or enthusiasm about candidates in much higher numbers than we’ve ever seen,\" she says. \"From a political standpoint, I think there’s just as much energy that we’ve seen in presidential years.\" In other election news: Trump praises \"Beautiful Ted.\" President Trump appeared at a Houston rally for Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday, where both men made it clear the bitterness of the 2016 campaign was behind them. Before he flew to Texas, Trump told reporters that he now called Cruz \"Beautiful Ted\" or \"Texas Ted\" instead of \"Lyin' Ted,\" reports the Washington Post. At the rally, the two men embraced and Cruz told the crowd that he is looking forward to hitting the campaign trail for Trump's re-election bid in 2020. Trump described Cruz's opponent, Beto O'Rourke, as \"overrated.\" \"You know what I am? I'm a nationalist.\" At the Cruz rally, Trump attacked Democrats as a \"big risk to the American family\" and accused them of \"encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation,\" the AP reports. He also attacked globalists, declaring himself to be a nationalist. GOP may have the edge in early voting. According to data analyzed by NBC News, talk of a \"blue wave\" may be overstated: In early voting, Republican-affiliated voters have outnumbered Democrats in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, and Texas, while Democrats are ahead in Nevada. Trump \"plans to distance himself from GOP losses.\" Insiders tell Politico that while Trump is currently describing the midterm vote as a vote on his presidency, he plans to break with recent precedent and distance himself from the results if there are serious GOP losses. The sources say Trump is likely to blame losses on House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—as well as the media. One GOP insider says Trump has said of McConnell and Ryan: \"These are their elections ... and if they screw it up, it's not my fault.\" Dems lower \"blue wave\" expectations. Trump may not have to distance himself from results: With congressional races tightening, Democrats have been trying to lower expectations of a \"blue wave,\" the Hill reports.

If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the solar system's models and potentially reclassify Pluto, which was demoted from planet status in 2006.\n\nMike Brown, one of the astronomers involved in the discovery, is known as the \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in Pluto's demotion. Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, initially set out to disprove the existence of a ninth planet but were unable to do so. Their research builds on earlier work by Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo, who suggested a giant planet could be influencing the orbits of smaller objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on multiple continents searching for the planet. The odds of its existence are estimated to be around 60% by Scott Sheppard, who co-authored the earlier paper that Brown and Batygin aimed to disprove. If discovered, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter around two to four times that of Earth.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would be significant, as it could help explain the clustering of small, icy objects in the outer solar system. The existence of such a planet would also support the theory that our solar system formed from a protoplanetary disk, with Planet Nine being a remnant from that early stage.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would not necessarily mean a reinstatement of Pluto as a planet, as it would need to meet the criteria set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

War has reached Damascus, with increased military presence, checkpoints, and violence. The city, once known for its vibrant nightlife and all-night parties, is now a city under siege, with few people venturing out after dark due to fears of kidnappings, suicide bombings, and increased violence. The city's infrastructure is also suffering, with shortages of gasoline, food, and heating oil, and streets being closed at a moment's notice.\n\n2. The ongoing battles between government and rebel forces are taking a toll on cities across Syria. The fighting has resulted in the destruction of oil and gas pipelines in the northeast, near the Iraqi border. Rebel attacks on these pipelines have been a recurring issue, as they are a crucial source of revenue for the government.\n\n3. The civil war is also impacting Syria's economy significantly. Wealthy Syrians, who have traditionally supported President Bashar al-Assad, are seeing their businesses suffer due to the conflict.

This growth is largely driven by the success of the film studio, particularly the theme park attractions based on popular movies like Cars Land at Disneyland. The success of these attractions has led to further investments in parks, cruise lines, and Asia, which Disney CEO Robert Iger expects to continue generating profits.\n\nHowever, the film industry as a whole is facing challenges, with mid-budget films becoming increasingly difficult to finance. Studios are focusing on big-budget films that generate significant revenue down the line, such as the Avengers franchise, which grossed $1.5 billion at the global box office. This shift towards blockbusters has made it difficult for smaller films to secure funding, with studios showing less interest in films that don't have potential for theme park rides, TV spin-offs, and merchandise.\n\nJohn Waters, a filmmaker whose last movie was released a decade ago, recently shared his struggle to secure funding for a new film. He lamented that the recession and the shift towards smaller budgets have made it difficult for independent filmmakers to finance their projects. This struggle is not unique to Waters; many filmmakers, including David Lynch and Spike Lee, have expressed similar sentiments.\n\nThe decline of mid-budget films has led to a decrease in the variety of films being produced, with studios focusing on big-budget blockbusters and low-budget indie films. This has left a gap in the market for adult-oriented, thoughtful films that don't fit into either category. The increased competition in the indie scene, coupled with the decline of the DVD market and the rise of streaming services, has made it difficult for independent films to find an audience and turn a profit.\n\nAs a result, many filmmakers are turning to television for opportunities to tell their stories.

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan.

A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing.

Zoo officials made the decision to shoot Harambe due to the perceived threat to the boy's life, as tranquilizers may not have taken effect in time and could have agitated the gorilla. The incident has sparked widespread outrage on social media, with many criticizing the boy's mother for negligence and calling for criminal charges against the parents. Some have also criticized the zoo for its response, while others have defended the zoo's actions.

The team's poor qualifying campaign saw them win only three games out of ten, with the final defeat being the most devastating.

The couple had been married for several years and were deeply in love, according to accounts. However, there is no evidence that Donna failed to recognize her husband or asked him not to touch her.\n\nThe case raises complex questions about consent and mental capacity in sexual relationships, particularly in cases of long-term partners or spouses with dementia. The law in Iowa treats spouses differently from others in such situations, but the statute does not seem to fully address the issue.\n\nThe Iowa law considers sexual abuse as third-degree sexual abuse if the act is done without the other person's consent, unless they are cohabiting as husband and wife. The law also considers it sexual abuse if the act is performed while the other person is mentally incapacitated, physically incapacitated, or physically helpless. However, the law does not seem to address the issue of long-term partners or spouses who are no longer cohabiting but have a history of consensual sexual activity.\n\nThe case of Henry Rayhons raises questions about the application of these laws in such situations.

Dunkin' Donuts emphasizes that their product is not a direct copy of the Cronut, but rather a result of their ongoing research into pastry trends. The company's President of Global Marketing and Innovation, John Costello, states that bakers have been combining doughnuts and croissants for at least 20 years, and Dunkin' has been exploring such \"combinations\" for several years.\n\nThe Cronut, priced at $5, has been a significant success for Dominique Ansel's bakery, despite its high price and long lines. The Cronut's popularity has led to increased security measures to manage the crowd and prevent solicitation.\n\nDunkin' Donuts' decision to introduce the Croissant Donut comes amidst challenges the company is facing, including increased competition and the need to meet growth targets. The company plans to expand its U.S. locations, aiming for over 17,000 locations in the future, up from the current 8,000.\n\nRob Branca, a Dunkin' Donuts franchisee, believes the Croissant Donut will be successful due to the ongoing popularity of the Cronut.

The new offering will have the same glaze as Dunkin's Glazed Donut, won't have filling (for now), and will sell for $2.49—more than twice what the chain's regular donuts go for, making it more profitable for a company that's seen flagging sales, the AP notes. DD won't cop to any Cronut copycat crime, though. \"Are we copying a specific bakery in New York? The answer is no,\" Dunkin's president of global marketing and innovation says. So what's the difference between the actual Cronut—which comes with a caveat on Dominique Ansel's website that the \"creation is not to be mistaken as simply croissant dough that has been fried\"—and DD's version?

The film, based on a $140 million budget, earned only $22 million in its North American debut over the July 4th weekend, a significant financial disappointment. The film's poor performance is attributed to several factors, including its release timing, the lack of recognizable stars, and the confusion surrounding the acronym title.\n\nThe BFG, short for the Big Friendly Giant, was expected to be a family-friendly blockbuster, but it faced stiff competition from other summer releases, such as Finding Dory and The Legend of Tarzan. The film's title, which may not be familiar to many, and the lack of big-name stars in the cast may have also contributed to its underperformance.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, with a respectable 71% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, but this was not enough to attract audiences. The film's visual effects were praised, but the emotional bond between the main characters was not considered compelling enough to sell the film to audiences.\n\nThe BFG's poor box office performance is significant because it marks a rare failure for Steven Spielberg, who has a long history of successful films.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

She and two other women from her village in northeastern China fled to Laos and Thailand, leaving behind Suh's 5-year-old daughter. They were forced to make the dangerous journey illegally, carrying Suh's 18-month-old daughter, Ji-yeon, on her back.\n\nAnother story reports on a group of North Korean women who were forcefully repatriated from China after being discovered engaging in prostitution while working at a food factory. The women were sent to China as part of a group of North Korean workers, but their handler instructed them to work as prostitutes at night. The women were deported by Chinese public security personnel after their activities were exposed.\n\nThe news also highlights the challenges faced by North Korean women in China, who are often sold to Chinese husbands and live secretly in remote villages. Many of these women are forced into prostitution, and even those who are not are at risk of being arrested and repatriated to North Korea, where they may face severe punishment, including time in labor camps.\n\nThe news pieces also discuss the increasing difficulty of escaping North Korea, as security has been tightened since Kim Jong Un took power in 2011.

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia.

The study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council, surveyed 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had experienced sudden bereavement.

Dr Alexandra Pitman, one of the study's authors, emphasizes that people bereaved by suicide should not feel responsible for the death and should be treated with the same compassion as those bereaved by any other cause.\n\nThe study also found that people bereaved by suicide tend to perceive more social stigma around the death. When the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared, suggesting that addressing the stigma attached to suicide bereavement could help limit its impact on people's lives.\n\nThe study's findings support the idea that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should also be considered when assessing suicide risk. This is because asking about the impact of a suicidal loss can provide insight into a person's day-to-day functioning and whether they have been prevented from accessing help due to stigma.\n\nThe study's findings underscore the importance of addressing the stigma surrounding suicide and offering support to those bereaved by suicide.

The website offers real-time counseling from trained professionals to help women understand the process and manage potential complications. The project is inspired by the stories of women who have already been taking matters into their own hands, particularly those living along the US-Mexico border where misoprostol, a miscarriage-causing drug, can be purchased over the counter in Central American pharmacies. The website does not provide the drugs to US women, but instead aims to support those who may be attempting self-induced abortions.\n\nThe legal risks of self-administering misoprostol are complicated, as the act of seeking information about self-induced abortion is protected by law, but the actual act of using the drug without medical supervision could potentially lead to charges such as child endangerment, practicing medicine without a license, or drug possession. The website's counselors will inform clients of these potential risks, but the legal implications are unclear. The act of self-induced abortion is estimated to be on the rise, particularly in states with restrictive abortion laws and limited access to clinics.

The country has been in a financial crisis since the mid-1990s, with repeated deficits and a rising debt burden. In 2010, Greece received a bailout, but the austerity measures imposed as a condition of the loan failed to produce the expected results, and the economy continued to struggle. In 2012, another bailout was undertaken, but the situation has not improved.\n\nIn January 2015, a new government, led by Alexis Tsipras, came to power and sought to renegotiate the terms of the bailout. The government wanted to reverse some of the austerity measures, receive debt relief, and reopen negotiations with creditors. However, the creditors have refused to negotiate, and the IMF loan that was due on June 29 was not repaid. As a result, Greece has been cut off from international credit markets, and banks have been closed since June 29.\n\nGreece's economy is already being squeezed, and the situation is expected to worsen if the country defaults on its debt. The head of Greece's banking association has warned that the banks will run out of funds by Monday. The Greek government has proposed a referendum to decide whether to accept the terms of a bailout offer from creditors or to reject it. The creditors have warned that a \"No\" vote could lead to Greece's expulsion from the European Union.\n\nIn a TV address, Tsipras called on voters to reject the creditors' offer and to vote \"No\" in the referendum. He argued that Greece needs debt relief and that the current bailout terms are unsustainable. Tsipras also urged voters to reject the \"sirens of scaremongering\" and to vote with confidence.\n\nThe referendum has been controversial, and there have been scuffles between protesters at rallies in Athens. A Greek court has rejected a challenge to the legality of the referendum, and the vote is expected to be close. Polls show that 74% of Greeks want to stay in the eurozone, but the two sides are evenly split on the bailout referendum.", "answers": ["Greece's top court has declared that Sunday's referendum on a bailout is constitutional, meaning the vote with huge implications for all of Europe will proceed.

The election was marked by controversy surrounding Hyde-Smith's comment about attending a \"public hanging\" if invited, which evoked the state's history of lynchings and racism.\n\nHyde-Smith's comment sparked a national outcry and fueled Democratic hopes of an upset, particularly among black voters. However, Hyde-Smith managed to depict Espy as too liberal for the state and emphasized her support for President Donald Trump, who held two get-out-the-vote rallies for her on Monday. Trump tweeted his congratulations to Hyde-Smith after the race was called.\n\nEspy, a former agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton, campaigned as a moderate who would work with Republicans to benefit the state. He tried to replicate the coalition that propelled Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate win in neighboring Alabama last year by energizing black voters, particularly women, and winning support from white swing voters. However, Espy's efforts were not enough to overcome Hyde-Smith's lead.\n\nHyde-Smith's victory means that Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate.

Plural marriage, the practice of one man being married to multiple women, was commanded by God through prophets, including Joseph Smith, the founder of the LDS Church. This practice was introduced incrementally and was initially met with resistance due to its foreign nature and cultural sensibilities.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was first introduced in the early 1840s under the direction of Joseph Smith, who received the commandment through revelation. The practice was seen as a means to increase the number of children born in the faith and to create a sense of cohesion among Latter-day Saints. It also helped shape 19th-century Mormon society by making marriage more accessible, reducing per-capita inequality, and increasing intermarriages among diverse populations.\n\nThe practice was initially kept confidential and was not widely accepted until after the Latter-day Saints had settled in Utah. Between 1852 and 1890, plural marriage was openly practiced in Utah, with most plural families consisting of two wives and two husbands. The practice was not mandatory, and women were free to choose whether to participate or not.\n\nIn 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage, and federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives. The Church responded by engaging in civil disobedience, continuing to practice plural marriage and avoiding arrest by moving to the homes of friends or family or hiding under assumed names.\n\nIn 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, declaring his intention to submit to the U.S. laws against plural marriage and to discontinue the practice. The end of plural marriage was a gradual process, filled with difficulties and uncertainties. The Church has since emphasized that members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriages and has urged local leaders to bring noncompliant members before Church disciplinary councils.\n\nThe news passages also discuss the personal experiences of those who practiced plural marriage, including Joseph Smith and his wife Emma.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The article \"Alabama Corporal Punishment in Public Schools Laws\" provides an overview of corporal punishment laws in Alabama, which allows the use of corporal punishment in public schools, but prohibits excessive force or cruel and unusual punishment. The article also mentions that Alabama is one of 15 states with a state law that explicitly allows corporal punishment.\n\n3. The article \"Alabama Paddles Students at Highest Rate in Nation, Data Shows\" reports on data from the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which shows that Alabama paddled nearly 19,000 students in the 2013-2014 school year, making it one of the states with the highest rate of corporal punishment in public schools. The article also discusses the racial disparities in corporal punishment, with black and multi-race students being paddled at a higher rate than white students.\n\n4. The American Psychological Association (APA) opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools, juvenile facilities, child care nurseries, and all other institutions where children are cared for or educated. The APA's position is based on research showing that corporal punishment can lower self-esteem, train children to use physical violence to control behavior, and may not be effective in reducing undesirable behavior.\n\n5. The City Council of a certain city passed a resolution opposing corporal punishment in schools, juvenile facilities, child care nurseries, and all other institutions where children are cared for or educated. The resolution cites research showing that corporal punishment can have negative effects on children's self-esteem, behavior, and socialization.\n\n6.

Boys get hit more than girls, and black children were paddled at a disproportionate rate compared to whites. It's a long-standing (and legal) disciplinary tradition in the state that locals don't seem terribly motivated to change: The National Education Association wants the practice banned, but the Alabama Education Association has stayed mum—despite the fact that it's illegal to paddle an adult in the state, per an opinion piece on AL.com. UNICEF's \"Violence Against Children\" report doesn't exactly support paddling enthusiasts, noting that studies have linked corporal punishment to poor mental health, social issues, and academic problems. And many educational and child advocacy groups, including the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, agree it's ill-advised. But a 1977 Supreme Court decision ruled corporal punishment was not cruel and unusual and that schools could decide whether to use it—and in 1995, Alabama lawmakers gave public schools the right to do so.

The use of e-cigarettes has surpassed traditional cigarette smoking among high school students, according to several studies. This trend is concerning because e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is addictive, and can potentially lead to lifelong addiction.\n\nOne study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, found that e-cigarette use among high school seniors in Southern California in 2014 was higher than the smoking rates in 2004, suggesting that e-cigarettes are not merely substituting for cigarettes but are instead attracting a new group of users who would not have used tobacco products otherwise. This finding is significant because it indicates that e-cigarettes may be contributing to the initiation of tobacco use among teenagers.\n\nAnother study found that adolescents who use e-cigarettes are six times more likely to initiate cigarette smoking within a year compared to those who have never used e-cigarettes. This suggests that e-cigarettes may serve as a gateway to traditional cigarette smoking.\n\nThe studies also highlight the lack of regulation in the e-cigarette industry, which makes it difficult to know what ingredients are in the products. Some e-cigarettes contain nicotine, while others claim to be nicotine-free. However, tests have shown that some products labeled as nicotine-free contain nicotine.\n\nThe increasing popularity of e-cigarettes among teenagers is a cause for concern because nicotine can damage the developing adolescent brain and increase the risk of lifelong addiction. The studies suggest that e-cigarettes may be recruiting a new generation of tobacco users, which could potentially erode the progress made in tobacco control over the past several decades.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced plans to regulate all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, cigars, and hookah tobacco.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014.

This finding challenges the long-held belief that only humans exhibit such specialization.\n\nThe study, published in Frontiers in Neuroscience, suggests that the left hemisphere's ability to process fast sounds may help bats communicate effectively, as their communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, is thought to help bats track the velocity of the insects they eat using sonar, which relies on detecting small changes in frequency.\n\nThe study also found that this asymmetrical sound processing is sex-dependent in bats, with males showing more asymmetry than females, which is consistent with human language processing. However, the researchers note that this asymmetry poses challenges for in-depth scientific studies of certain communication disorders, such as aphasia, due to the methods used in these studies often requiring animal-specific methods that are not always permissible.\n\nThe study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The researchers report no financial conflicts of interest related to the study.\n\nThis discovery could potentially help in understanding certain human language disorders and improving computer speech recognition.

Turns out we're not as special as we thought. A type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing, Washington has discovered. In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains—the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience. The left is used \"to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because (the bats') communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency.\" All this is more than just a matter of interest: The findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \"can only be permitted in animals,\" Washington adds.

The DNA evidence, which was previously believed to have exonerated the Ramsey family, has been analyzed by independent experts who found that the genetic profile may not be from a single individual and could be a composite of multiple individuals. This new information contradicts the conclusions made by former Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy in her 2008 letter exonerating the Ramseys.\n\nThe DNA evidence was found on JonBenet's long johns and underwear, and Lacy had the items tested for touch DNA in 2008. She based her decision to exonerate the Ramseys on the belief that the DNA belonged to the unknown killer. However, the new analysis suggests that the DNA samples may contain genetic material from JonBenet, an unknown male, and at least one other unidentified person.\n\nThe experts also noted that the DNA profile may be a composite, which could render it useless as evidence. Additionally, they suggested that the presence of the DNA on JonBenet's undergarments could have an innocent explanation, such as being transferred from another piece of clothing or from inconsequential contact with other people.\n\nThe new findings have been met with mixed reactions. Some believe that the DNA evidence still supports the intruder theory, while others argue that it does not implicate or exonerate anyone in the family. The Ramseys' lawyer, Lin Wood, has expressed confidence in Lacy's decision and believes that the new evidence will lead to a reinvestigation of other potential suspects.\n\nThe investigation into JonBenet's murder remains open, and the Boulder Police Department continues to receive new tips as the 20th anniversary of her death approaches. The case has attracted renewed attention, and the Ramseys' son, Burke, recently filed a defamation lawsuit against a forensic pathologist who accused him of being involved in his sister's death.", "answers": ["After just short of 20 years, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is as much of a mystery as ever—especially in light of a new examination of DNA evidence.

At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion.

The storm's intensity and the amount of rain it has produced are attributed to warmer air and water due to global warming. Warmer air can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall, and warmer water in the Gulf of Mexico provides more fuel for hurricanes.\n\nThe storm has also been used as a political talking point, with some accusing CNN of politicizing the disaster by discussing climate change in its coverage. Fox News, in particular, criticized CNN for bringing up climate change during the storm, accusing the network of using the disaster to advance a leftist agenda. However, experts argue that it is important to discuss the role of climate change in intensifying storms like Harvey, as it could provide valuable insights for future disaster preparedness and response.\n\nThe aftermath of the storm has also raised questions about the role of the government in funding recovery efforts and the cost of such disasters. Congress has faced partisan divides in the past when it comes to funding for disaster relief, with some conservatives advocating for offsetting aid with spending cuts in other programs.

That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Another man, Lazerick Eskridge, suffered severe complications after his transplant, including kidney failure, multiple infections, and an injured diaphragm.\n\nThe articles also discuss the hiring of Dr. Jeffrey Morgan as the surgical director of the heart transplant program in 2016.

Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart.

The TIU, which was set up to enforce fair play in tennis, has been criticized for not taking action against the players, with some former integrity chiefs accusing the sport of failing to address the problem. The investigation found that betting syndicates in Russia, northern Italy, and Sicily made hundreds of thousands of pounds betting on matches they suspected were fixed, including three matches at Wimbledon. The TIU has a zero-tolerance approach to betting-related corruption but has not pursued investigations into the players mentioned in the 2008 report, citing legal advice that previous corruption offenses cannot be pursued under the new anti-corruption code introduced in 2009. The TIU has been warned about the suspicious activity of at least a third of the players implicated in the investigation, but none have been disciplined. The TIU has welcomed the support of the betting industry and said it analyzes, assesses, and investigates all credible information received. The problem of suspicious betting and match-fixing is not going away, with eight of the players implicated in the investigation set to play in the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, January 18.

However, a recent investigation by Politico has revealed that the seven individuals released were not just \"civilians\" as portrayed by the Obama administration, but were accused of posing threats to national security. Some were part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics and other technology with applications in surface-to-air and cruise missiles, and one was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology. The administration dropped charges and international arrest warrants for 14 other fugitives, but did not disclose their names or the nature of their alleged crimes. One of the fugitives was accused of procuring U.S. military antennas for use in IEDs that killed U.S. military personnel in Iraq. Another was involved in procuring parts for Iran's uranium enrichment centrifuges, which were a key focus of the nuclear deal negotiations. The Obama administration has denied that the released individuals could still be prosecuted if they continue their illegal activities, but critics say the release of these dangerous individuals undermines U.S. national security and the administration's own non-proliferation efforts. The investigation also found that the Obama administration undermined its own counterproliferation efforts by slowing down investigations into Iranian procurement networks and denying requests to extradite suspects. This was done in order to facilitate the nuclear deal and prisoner swap, and some former officials have expressed frustration and anger over the decision.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors.

The Code of Conduct for United States Judges states that judges should avoid political activity, and Ginsburg's comments have raised questions about her impartiality and the potential for recusal in cases involving Trump. Trump has responded by calling on Ginsburg to resign, and the controversy has raised concerns about the politicization of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition to the Ginsburg controversy, there have been proposed changes to the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges and the Judicial Conduct and Disability Rules. The proposed changes include revisions to Canon 3, which deals with a judge's duty to perform their duties fairly, impartially, and diligently, and Canon 5, which prohibits political activity. The changes aim to clarify and update the Code to better reflect current practices and expectations.\n\nFinally, there is a reminder to review the proposed changes to the Code of Conduct and the Judicial Conduct and Disability Rules, as well as the public comments and witness statements, and to watch the public hearing. The hearing will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to learn more about the proposed changes and offer feedback. The proposed changes are intended to ensure that judges uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary and maintain high standards of conduct.", "answers": ["Ruth Bader Ginsburg would probably need something harder than a bottle of fine California wine to get her to vote for Donald Trump in November—in fact, she doesn't even want to think about him as president, as she told the AP in an interview last week before piling on the Trump disparagement even further with the New York Times and CNN. The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

The device, which uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), was tested on four patients who had been diagnosed with Complete Locked-In Syndrome (CLIS), a condition caused by ALS that leaves patients paralyzed but cognitively intact. The patients were trained to think 'yes' or 'no' in response to simple questions, and the device was able to accurately classify their responses with over 70% accuracy.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, is significant because it represents the first time reliable communication has been established with CLIS patients. The researchers found that all four patients indicated they were 'happy' with their lives, suggesting that CLIS may not be the living hell many presume it to be. However, not all answers were positive, as one patient's daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend, to which the patient answered 'no' nine times out of ten.\n\nThe device has the potential to transform the lives of CLIS patients and their families, as it allows for more personal and meaningful communication. The researchers plan to build a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than just answering questions.\n\nAdrian Owen, a neuroscientist at the University of Western Ontario, has been exploring the use of fNIRS to communicate with other brain-injured patients, including those presumed to be in a vegetative state. Owen believes that if the findings can be replicated in a larger group of patients, fNIRS may be the answer to finding a portable, cost-effective, and reliable means of communication for these patients.\n\nOverall, the study represents a significant step forward in communication for CLIS patients and offers hope for a more fulfilling life for those affected by the condition.", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

{"pred": "Bob Dylan, the Nobel laureate for literature, has been accused of plagiarizing portions of his Nobel Prize lecture from SparkNotes, an online equivalent of CliffsNotes. The accusation, made by Washington D.C. journalist Andrea Pitzer, suggests that Dylan's lecture, which discussed the influence of \"Moby-Dick\" on him, contains passages that closely resemble phrases from the SparkNotes summary of the novel, rather than the novel itself. Pitzer provides side-by-side comparisons of the SparkNotes and Dylan's speech to support her claim. This is not the first time Dylan has been accused of plagiarism; similar allegations have been made about his work since his first album, \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.\" In response to these accusations, Dylan has stated that in the realm of songwriting, quotation is a tradition that is enriching and true for everyone, but not for him. He has also argued that he works within the rules and limitations of his art form, which he defines as melody and rhythm, and that anything goes after that. The Swedish Academy, which awarded Dylan the Nobel Prize, has not yet commented on the plagiarism allegations. Some critics, such as David Yaffe, a Syracuse University professor, have defended Dylan, stating that they are not less moved by his lecture knowing the allegations, and that they do not detract from its value. Others, like Alex Lubet, a University of Minnesota music professor, consider the use of collage techniques in the lecture to be acceptable in a post-modern work of art.", "answers": ["Bob Dylan delivered what was described as an \"eloquent\" lecture this month as part of his Nobel prize requirements—but one writer says he may have approached the task like a high school student with an overdue project.

She says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble SparkNotes passages and compares several of them side by side. Multiple phrases, including \"Ahab's lust for vengeance,\" appear both in SparkNotes and Dylan's talk, but not in Moby Dick itself. He had to give the talk to collect $922,000 in prize money. \"Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness,\" a quote that one blogger thought Dylan had invented, appears to be based on SparkNotes. Pitzer suggests that Dylan donate some of the prize money to the SparkNotes writer, though others are more forgiving. University of Minnesota music professor Alex Lubet tells the Star-Tribune that Dylan's lecture shouldn't be treated like a classroom assignment. \"His lecture is wild and strange,\" Lubet says. \"It’s meant to be a post-modern work of art.

The struck-down provisions included a requirement for immigrants to carry registration documents, a prohibition on seeking work, and a provision allowing police to arrest individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.\n\nArizona Governor Jan Brewer celebrated the ruling, calling it a \"victory for the rule of law\" and a \"legal victory\" for her state.

Gargiulo, two men who were texting a driver at the time of a fatal accident are being sued for their role in the crash. The judge's decision follows a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established the same cause of action against third parties in motor vehicle accident litigation.\n\nThe Pennsylvania ruling sets a high bar for proving liability, as the third parties must have known the driver was driving and would view the text while behind the wheel. This could potentially make it difficult for plaintiffs to prove their case, but it could also open the door for more lawsuits against texters who distract drivers.\n\nIn addition to these legal developments, there is growing concern about the increasing rates of distracted driving, particularly with the proliferation of new social media apps and the temptation they present for drivers to take their eyes off the road. A recent study found that distracted driving rates are increasing every year, while drunk driving rates have declined.\n\nOne proposed solution to combat distracted driving is the use of \"textalyzers,\" a technology currently under development by an Israeli firm.

The AP reports that he's likely to be remembered for his humanitarian work, for lowering the minimum age for missionaries to 18 for men and 19 for women—and for leading his church's support of California's same-sex marriage ban in 2008. The Deseret News notes that Monson also, as chairman of the Missionary Executive Committee, assigned the first black Mormon missionary. No successor has been named yet, but under church protocol, the next president will be 93-year-old Russell Nelson, who is now the longest-serving member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8480}

The settlement comes after Carlson accused Ailes of sexual harassment and retaliation following her complaints about inappropriate behavior. The settlement includes a public apology from Fox News, which is representing Ailes in the matter. Ailes has repeatedly denied the allegations. The settlement also reportedly includes a clause that prevents Carlson from bringing further legal action against Fox News or its executives.\n\nThe settlement follows a series of events that began when Carlson filed her lawsuit in July. The lawsuit led to an investigation by Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, and the resignation of Ailes. Since then, more than two dozen women have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Ailes.\n\nIn addition to the settlement with Carlson, Fox News has reportedly reached settlements with two other women who made similar claims. The company has also agreed to a public apology as part of the settlement.\n\nThe settlement also marks the end of a legal battle between Ailes and Fox News. Ailes had previously threatened to sue the network for defamation in response to the allegations against him. However, it is unclear if Ailes will be personally liable for any portion of the settlement.\n\nThe settlement is a significant development in the ongoing saga of sexual harassment at Fox News and the downfall of Ailes, who built the network into a conservative powerhouse over the past 20 years.

Sources tell Vanity Fair that two other women were also granted settlements, and that as part of Carlson's settlement, she's agreed not to take any more legal action against Fox or its execs.

This gap has been growing since the 1960s, with the ratio of CEO to worker pay rising from 20:1 in 1965 to 344:1 in 2000 and 327:1 in 2007. The rise in CEO compensation can be attributed to stock-related components such as stock awards and stock options, which accounted for 99.1% of the growth in CEO compensation in 2017.\n\nThe report also highlighted the issue of missing data in the \"fair value\" of stock awards, which led to an underestimation of CEO compensation. To compensate for this, the researchers used trends in the cost of stock awards to estimate the fair value of stock awards in 2017.\n\nThe report also discussed the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio as reported by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in accordance with the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill of 2010. However, the SEC's method of calculating this ratio was criticized for its ambiguity and lack of standardization across firms, making comparisons difficult.\n\nThe report concluded that the market for skills cannot fully explain the rise in CEO compensation, as other high-wage earners have also seen growth in their pay. Instead, it suggested that CEO compensation reflects the power of CEOs to extract concessions, with a significant portion of the pay not reflecting actual productivity or contribution to economic output. The report also noted that the growth in CEO compensation has contributed to the growth of top 1% incomes and has limited the availability of income for broader-based wage growth.\n\nThe report suggested several policy options to reverse the trend of excessive CEO pay, including higher marginal income tax rates, higher corporate tax rates for firms with high CEO-to-worker compensation ratios, and greater use of \"say on pay\" in corporate governance.", "answers": ["For every dollar made by the average Facebook employee, Mark Zuckerberg earned $37 in 2017.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

The study, which involved 15,000 sets of twins, found that the geek index score increased with the age of the father, with the effect being more pronounced in boys. The researchers from King's College London and the University of Southern California collected data on the twins' cognitive and behavioral traits at the age of 12, and found that geekier boys performed better in school, particularly in STEM subjects.\n\nThe study's findings offer some positive aspects of having an older father, as previous research has shown that having children later in life can increase the risk of autism and schizophrenia. The researchers suggest that there may be evolutionary advantages to having an older father, as geekier traits may be beneficial in a knowledge-driven economy.\n\nThe study's authors acknowledge that the findings should not be used to guide individual decisions about parenthood, as the effects may vary in individual families. They also note that the study does not account for other factors that could contribute to geekiness, such as socioeconomic status and education level.\n\nThe study also suggests a link between autism and geekiness, as some of the genes associated with geekiness may also be associated with autism. The researchers suggest that if a child inherits only some of these genes, they may be more likely to succeed in school, but if they inherit more of these genes, they may be at a higher risk of autism.\n\nThe study found no significant impact of the mother's age on the geek index score. The researchers suggest that the study may not have captured how girls display geekiness, or that girls may be geeky in different ways than boys. They also suggest that girls may be protected from autism in a similar way that they are protected from the geek index effect.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate about the potential benefits of having an older father.

More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
