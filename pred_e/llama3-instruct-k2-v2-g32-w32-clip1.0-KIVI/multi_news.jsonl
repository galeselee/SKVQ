According to Jennifer Allyn, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, what girls need now is encouragement to become leaders and a deeper understanding of what leadership entails.\n\nThe solution lies in taking girls to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, and introducing them to female role models who can inspire and mentor them. Companies can achieve this by shifting their focus on Take Our Children to Work Day to include female leaders, providing opportunities for girls to interact with them, and highlighting their accomplishments. This can help close the gap in leadership aspirations between girls and boys, as a recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80 percent of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60 percent have not been offered the opportunity.\n\nMoreover, companies need to provide sponsorship initiatives, which provide opportunities and support to female protégés, rather than just mentorship.

The team, led by Xavier Nieto Prieto, former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, examined the wreck and found that the artefacts found at the site were from a ship from a much later period, likely from the 17th or 18th century. The ship, which was discovered by US marine archaeologist Barry Clifford in May, was initially believed to be the Santa Maria, but Unesco experts have now ruled out this possibility.\n\nThe Unesco team found that the ship's fasteners were made of copper alloy, whereas the Santa Maria would have had iron and/or wood fixations. They also concluded that the site where the wreck was found was further away from the shore than expected, and that the ship's construction techniques and materials were inconsistent with those of the Santa Maria.\n\nThe discovery has sparked controversy, with some experts disagreeing with Unesco's findings. Professor Charles Beeker, a US underwater archaeologist, believes that the site is still the best candidate for the Santa Maria's wreck and that a more thorough investigation is needed. He also criticized Unesco's ideas about the ship's location, saying that it would have been impossible for the Santa Maria to drift onto land.\n\nThe Santa Maria was the flagship of Columbus's three-vessel fleet that discovered the New World.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which prevent the fish's blood from freezing in the freezing waters of Antarctica, have been found to also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. This means that the fish may never be able to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which could potentially cause life-threatening problems.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of marine biologists who studied the fish's behavior and physiology in their natural habitat. They found that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. This means that the fish's bodies may become superheated, with the ice crystals remaining intact even at temperatures above the expected melting point.\n\nThe researchers also found that the ice crystals accumulate in the fish's spleens, and it is possible that the fish have evolved a mechanism to filter them out of their circulation. However, the long-term cost of this adaptation is still unknown, and it is possible that the fish may be vulnerable to the accumulation of ice crystals in their bodies.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of evolution and the adaptation of species to their environments. It shows that every evolutionary innovation comes with unintended consequences, and that species may have to adapt to these consequences in order to survive.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides new insights into the biology and ecology of Antarctic notothenioid fish. The research has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of life in extreme environments and the adaptations that species make to survive in these environments.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is more concise and easy to read:\n\nAntarctic Notothenioid Fish's Antifreeze Proteins Have Unintended Consequences\n\nScientists have discovered that the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish, which prevent their blood from freezing in the freezing waters, also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies. This means that the fish may never be able to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which could cause life-threatening problems.\n\nThe researchers found that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. The ice crystals accumulate in the fish's spleens, and it is possible that the fish have evolved a mechanism to filter them out of their circulation.\n\nThe study highlights the unintended consequences of evolutionary adaptations and the challenges", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}
