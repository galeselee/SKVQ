According to Jennifer Allyn, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, what girls need now is encouragement to become leaders and a deeper understanding of what leadership entails.\n\nThe solution lies in taking girls to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, and introducing them to female role models who can inspire and mentor them. Companies can achieve this by shifting their focus on Take Our Children to Work Day to include female leaders, providing opportunities for girls to interact with them, and highlighting their accomplishments. This can help close the gap in leadership aspirations between girls and boys, as a recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80 percent of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60 percent have not been offered the opportunity.\n\nMoreover, companies need to provide sponsorship initiatives, which provide opportunities and support to female protégés, rather than just mentorship.

The team, led by Xavier Nieto Prieto, former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, examined the wreck and found that the artefacts found at the site were from a ship from a much later period, likely from the 17th or 18th century. The ship, which was discovered by US marine archaeologist Barry Clifford in May, was initially believed to be the Santa Maria, but Unesco experts have now ruled out this possibility.\n\nThe Unesco team found that the ship's fasteners were made of copper alloy, whereas the Santa Maria would have had iron and/or wood fixations. They also concluded that the site where the wreck was found was further away from the shore than expected, and that the ship's construction techniques and materials were inconsistent with those of the Santa Maria.\n\nThe discovery has sparked controversy, with some experts disagreeing with Unesco's findings. Professor Charles Beeker, a US underwater archaeologist, believes that the site is still the best candidate for the Santa Maria's wreck and that a more thorough investigation is needed. He also criticized Unesco's ideas about the ship's location, saying that it would have been impossible for the Santa Maria to drift onto land.\n\nThe Santa Maria was the flagship of Columbus's three-vessel fleet that discovered the New World.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which prevent the fish's blood from freezing in the freezing waters of Antarctica, have been found to also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. This means that the fish may never be able to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which could potentially cause life-threatening problems.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of marine biologists who studied the fish's behavior and physiology in their natural habitat. They found that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. This means that the fish's bodies may become superheated, with the ice crystals remaining intact even at temperatures above the expected melting point.\n\nThe researchers also found that the ice crystals accumulate in the fish's spleens, and it is possible that the fish have evolved a mechanism to filter them out of their circulation. However, the long-term cost of this adaptation is still unknown, and it is possible that the fish may be vulnerable to the accumulation of ice crystals in their bodies.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of evolution and the adaptation of species to their environments. It shows that every evolutionary innovation comes with unintended consequences, and that species may have to adapt to these consequences in order to survive.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides new insights into the biology and ecology of Antarctic notothenioid fish.

This means that the fish may never be able to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which could cause life-threatening problems.\n\nThe researchers found that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. The ice crystals accumulate in the fish's spleens, and it is possible that the fish have evolved a mechanism to filter them out of their circulation.\n\nThe study highlights the unintended consequences of evolutionary adaptations and the challenges", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

The Pacific Fishery Management Council, responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to take action to protect the sardine population.\n\nThe council is being asked to set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and to fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of sardines has already had a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many predators, including brown pelicans, sea lions, and other marine mammals, struggling to find food.\n\nScientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but natural climate cycles and overfishing are both being considered as possible factors. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a naturally occurring climate cycle, has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, which may be repelling sardines. Additionally, the sardine population has been heavily exploited in the past, and the current decline may be a result of a combination of these factors.\n\nThe decline of sardines has significant economic and environmental implications. Forage fish, including sardines, account for over one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are worth billions of dollars when left in the water.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift.

Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1889}

Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The crisis is attributed to a combination of skyrocketing unemployment and poor planning by some states.\n\nAccording to a report by ProPublica, a non-profit newsroom, the average business owner in the US will pay higher unemployment taxes this year, with some states increasing taxes by as much as 200%. For example, in Virginia, the average tax on employers will increase to $171 from $95 per employee, while in Hawaii, employers will pay an average of $1,070 per worker.\n\nThe crisis has been exacerbated by the recession, which has left 5.5 million Americans collecting state jobless benefits. As a result, 25 states have borrowed over $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks flowing. Nine more states are expected to borrow by mid-year.\n\nThe tax increases and benefit cuts are expected to have a negative impact on the economy, as they may discourage employers from hiring and could lead to further joblessness. Economists argue that the measures undermine the purpose of the unemployment insurance system, which is to stimulate the economy during times of economic downturn.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for seniors, who are being hit with benefit cuts. In Virginia, for example, seniors will see their monthly benefits cut by as much as $190, while in Hawaii, the maximum benefit is being reduced by as much as a third.\n\nThe crisis is attributed to poor planning by some states, which failed to maintain adequate trust funds to cover unemployment benefits.

The Clarion nightsnake, a long, dark-spotted snake, was first discovered in 1936 by American naturalist William Beebe on the Pacific island of Clarion. However, subsequent searches failed to find any more individuals, and the species was largely forgotten.\n\nThe rediscovery was made by a team of researchers led by Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, and Juan Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands. The team used Beebe's original field notes as a guide and conducted DNA analysis to confirm the species' existence.\n\nThe Clarion nightsnake is found exclusively on the island and is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast, over 500 miles away. The team believes that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey to the island on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also because of the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands are inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines, and the island's ecosystem is vulnerable to external threats.\n\nThe National Museum of Natural History has recognized the Clarion nightsnake as a full species, and the team plans to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the island's ecosystem.

The virus is spread through direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids, or contaminated surfaces.\n\n**Quarantine and Testing**\n\nAbout 80 people who came into contact with the victim have been quarantined, including 60 healthcare workers.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap.

These compounds are thought to originate from the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids and esters, which are derived from the reaction of acids with alcohols.\n\nThe study also found that nitrogen-containing compounds, such as pyridine, are released during the decomposition of proteins and nucleic acids. Pyridine was previously detected in human and pig remains, and is thought to originate from niacin, a precursor of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP).\n\nThe researchers used a validated method of thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) to analyze the VOCs, and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the compounds that distinguish human and animal remains. The study found that pig remains could be separated from human remains based on five esters, and that human remains could be separated from other animal remains based on a combination of eight compounds.\n\nWhile the study has limitations, including the use of glass jars and the absence of environmental parameters, it is an important step in the search for human specific markers.

This ice loss has contributed to a global sea level rise of about 3/10 of an inch (7.6 mm) over the past quarter century.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 10 to 15 satellites, as well as ground and air measurements, and computer simulations, found that the melting is occurring at a rate that is not natural and is likely driven by climate change. The warming of the southern ocean, which is connected to global warming, is causing the melting of the ice sheets from below.\n\nThe study also found that the melting is not uniform, with West Antarctica losing more than 70% of its ice since 2012, while East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4511}

Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.
