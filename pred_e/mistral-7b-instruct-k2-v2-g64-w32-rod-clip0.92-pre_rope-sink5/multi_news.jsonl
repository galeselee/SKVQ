He provided funding for the building of over 5,300 schools for African-American children, many of which were named after him.\n\nThe documentaries \"Rosenwald\" by Aviva Kempner and the biography by Peter Ascoli bring to light Rosenwald's impact on African-American communities and his dedication to improving the lives of African-Americans. The films feature interviews with prominent African-Americans such as Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, all of whom attended Rosenwald schools as children.\n\nThe documentaries also highlight Rosenwald's personal and professional connections to Booker T.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The UK government is facing criticism for missing signs that could have prevented the murder, but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles defends the security services, stating it is impossible to control everyone in a free society. Drummer Rigby, a 25-year-old soldier who served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus, was murdered in a street in Woolwich, south-east London. The suspects were filmed by a passerby, with Adebolajo stating they carried out the attack because British soldiers kill Muslims every day. Armed police arrived on the scene 13 minutes after the first 999 call and shot the two suspects, who were taken to separate London hospitals in stable conditions. A prayer service was held in Drummer Rigby's hometown of Middleton, Greater Manchester, and residents are being urged to fly union jacks in his honor. The former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, Richard Barrett, expressed difficulty in detecting attacks like the one in Woolwich, as the suspects had no overseas connections or broader connections in the UK that could be detected by the security services.\n\nThe second passage reveals footage obtained by the Daily Mirror showing the suspects hatching a plot to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. The suspects lured the police to the scene by dragging the soldier's body into the middle of the road.

However, it is argued that this initiative's focus should shift towards encouraging girls to become leaders, particularly by exposing them to the C-Suite. The current state of women's representation in leadership roles is dismal, with women making up only a small percentage of CEOs, executive officers, and board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo address this issue, companies are encouraged to make several changes. First, they should introduce girls to female role models within the company, as seeing successful women in leadership roles can inspire girls and make leadership more tangible. Second, companies should clearly explain the responsibilities, rewards, and requirements of leadership roles to girls from a young age. This understanding can help them make informed decisions about their careers.\n\nThird, companies should implement proactive efforts to identify and groom female talent throughout the year. This can include encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, as was done at Princeton University, which saw a significant increase in the number of female Rhodes Scholars after implementing such a program.\n\nFinally, companies should provide sponsorship opportunities for women, as sponsors can provide valuable support and opportunities that mentors cannot. This can include advocating for women's careers and providing them with access to valuable networks and resources.\n\nThe importance of these changes is emphasized, as women's underrepresentation in leadership roles is costing companies talent, hurting the country's competitiveness, and undermining ideals of fairness and social equality.

{"pred": "In the news, the focus is on the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg. The meeting, which was highly anticipated, was described as a personal encounter between the two leaders, with Trump expressing his eagerness for the discussion. The meeting was significant due to the ongoing tension between the two countries over issues such as Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and the ongoing investigations into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nThe meeting was held in a private setting, with only the two presidents, their foreign ministers, and two translators present. This was seen as a strategic move by Putin, as it would prevent any leaks, similar to what happened during Lavrov's visit to the White House in May. The length of the meeting, which ran over its scheduled time, was emphasized by Russian media as a sign of Russia's importance.\n\nTrump and Putin were filmed shaking hands at the summit, and the US president wrote on Twitter that he looked forward to the meeting and would represent the country well. However, Trump's stance on the Russian interference in the election was ambiguous, as he did not definitively confirm the US intelligence officials' claims.\n\nAhead of the meeting, three US senators expressed concern about reports that the US administration was considering the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York, which were seized by the Obama administration in response to alleged Russian election meddling. The senators warned that such a move would embolden Putin and encourage further Russian interference in Western elections.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled shortly after a G20 working session on climate and energy, which Trump was expected to leave early to make the Russia meeting. The meeting was seen as an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss ways to stabilize war-ravaged Syria, with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stating that the US was prepared to explore the possibility of joint mechanisms for ensuring stability in Syria.\n\nThe meeting also came at a time when Trump was grappling with a response to North Korea's successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Trump met with leaders from Japan and South Korea to discuss the issue, and was also scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20", "answers": ["For the first time since becoming POTUS, Donald Trump has met Russian President Vladimir Putin.

This legislation, a key election pledge by President Francois Hollande, was passed with a clear majority of 329 votes in favor and 229 against. The bill redefines marriage as a contract between two people, rather than a union between a man and a woman, and will now move to the Senate for approval.\n\nIf passed, France will join other gay-marriage friendly countries such as Spain, Sweden, South Africa, and the Netherlands. The United States, with nine states and Washington D.C. having legalized same-sex marriage, and the United Kingdom, where lawmakers have recently voted for marriage equality, are also among the nations that have made strides in this area.\n\nThe approval of this bill marks President Hollande's first major social reform. However, the move has been met with significant opposition, particularly from conservative Catholics and social conservatives. The Catholic Church, along with other religious groups like Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists, have expressed their concerns over the draft bill.\n\nThe debate surrounding the bill has been contentious, with over 5,000 amendments proposed by the conservative opposition to delay proceedings. The issue has sparked some of the largest protests in decades, with around 340,000 people turning out in Paris on January 14 to protest the reform. The anti-gay marriage camp, driven largely by the Catholic Church, has promised to stage a new rally on March 24.\n\nDespite the opposition, supporters of the bill, including gay rights advocates, view this as a major advance for equality of rights. They argue that the law provides an opportunity to end outdated discrimination and protect all families without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe bill also includes plans for lesbians to access medically assisted procreation, a provision that was postponed due to the debate. A separate law on this issue will be debated later in the year.\n\nThe issue of same-sex marriage has been divisive globally, with polls showing that while the public has become more accepting, many people remain opposed.

Three years after the trial, Cheney Mason, one of Anthony's defense attorneys, has written a book titled \"Justice in America: How Prosecutors and the Media Conspire Against the Accused.\" In the book, Mason discusses the trial, the media coverage, and the bias he believes was present.\n\nMason, a Florida attorney, was initially offended by the media's treatment of his relatively inexperienced co-counsel, Jose Baez. He started advising Baez and eventually joined the defense team pro bono. During the trial, Mason was surprised by Anthony's small stature and was impressed by her demeanor. He claims that she was quiet, afraid, and unsure.\n\nOne of the key moments in the trial was when Baez revealed during his opening statement that Anthony had been a victim of sexual abuse by her father. Mason was concerned about the defense's ability to prove this, as they did not have concrete evidence. The prosecution responded by calling George Anthony, Casey's father, as their first witness, who denied the allegations.\n\nThe trial lasted for several weeks, with the prosecution presenting a largely circumstantial case. The defense maintained that Caylee did not die at the hands of Casey but drowned in the family's pool, and Casey and her father panicked and covered up the death. Casey Anthony was acquitted of the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, but was convicted of four misdemeanors for providing false information to law enforcement.\n\nThree years after the trial, Casey Anthony is living in hiding due to public hatred and threats. She works from home as a housekeeper, clerk, and secretary. Mason believes she is still imprisoned by the public's hatred and cannot go out in public due to the threats.
