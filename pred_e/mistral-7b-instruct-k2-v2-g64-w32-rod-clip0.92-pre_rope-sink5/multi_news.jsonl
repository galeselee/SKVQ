{"pred": "Scott Sears, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, has achieved the record of becoming the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo, completing a 702-mile trek in 38 days through harsh Antarctic conditions. He pulled a sled carrying supplies and navigated through 150mph winds, temperatures of -50°C, and crevasse-filled terrain. His journey began at Hercules Inlet, where the ground is riddled with crevasses, and he faced the challenge of traveling alone, without the safety of being roped to a teammate.\n\nSears, who is the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray, experienced a particularly challenging day just 38km (24 miles) from his destination on Christmas Eve. He hit a wall midway through the day, but managed to push through with some rest and motivation from his iPod. He even hung his socks as makeshift stockings on Christmas Eve, hoping Santa wouldn't miss him.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Sears reached the South Pole, arriving a week earlier than expected. He wrote that he was \"absolutely chuffed to pieces\" and looked forward to the experience sinking in. He is currently waiting for a plane to take him back to Union Glacier, expressing that the experience has been overwhelming due to his isolation for nearly six weeks.\n\nSears's expedition has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust, an organization that helps rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. His mother-in-law, Judy Murray, congratulated him on Twitter. The Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears's feat will make it into the record books.", "answers": ["While many people were unwrapping gifts on Christmas Day, the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray was wrapping up a 700-mile, 38-day journey through brutally cold temps and blistering winds—and, he hopes, setting a world record. Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.

{"pred": "Michael David Elliot, a 40-year-old man serving five life sentences for four 1993 murders, escaped from the Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan on Sunday and was captured in LaPorte County, Indiana, on Monday evening. Elliot allegedly stole four vehicles during his 24-hour run from the law, leading to a chase that ended in LaPorte County. He was arraigned in Indiana on auto theft charges and is being held without bond.\n\nThe manhunt for Elliot began after he escaped from the prison around 7 p.m. on Sunday. He was reportedly wearing a white kitchen uniform, which authorities believe helped him evade security cameras and fencing. Elliot carjacked a woman and held her hostage during his getaway, but she managed to escape and call the police.\n\nElliot's vehicle was found in Shipshewana, Indiana, on Monday afternoon, and authorities believe he may have been in the area since as early as 5:30 a.m. They went door-to-door in the community, but their search was suspended without any new leads.\n\nElliot was captured in LaPorte County, Indiana, after a short chase that ended with him sliding into a snowbank. He was polite and quiet during the arrest and did not resist. No one was injured during the incident.\n\nGovernor Rick Snyder of Michigan thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the search and capture of Elliot, and promised a thorough review of the situation that led to the escape. Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993, and authorities are reminding the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.

A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot \"can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence. Then a call about a stolen vehicle came in to the LaPorte County Sheriff's Office, and a deputy saw the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, WOOD-TV reports. But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked.
