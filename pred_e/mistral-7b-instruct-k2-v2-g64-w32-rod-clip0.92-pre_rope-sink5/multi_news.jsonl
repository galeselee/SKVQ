He provided funding for the building of over 5,300 schools for African-American children, many of which were named after him.\n\nThe documentaries \"Rosenwald\" by Aviva Kempner and the biography by Peter Ascoli bring to light Rosenwald's impact on African-American communities and his dedication to improving the lives of African-Americans. The films feature interviews with prominent African-Americans such as Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, all of whom attended Rosenwald schools as children.\n\nThe documentaries also highlight Rosenwald's personal and professional connections to Booker T.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The UK government is facing criticism for missing signs that could have prevented the murder, but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles defends the security services, stating it is impossible to control everyone in a free society. Drummer Rigby, a 25-year-old soldier who served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus, was murdered in a street in Woolwich, south-east London. The suspects were filmed by a passerby, with Adebolajo stating they carried out the attack because British soldiers kill Muslims every day. Armed police arrived on the scene 13 minutes after the first 999 call and shot the two suspects, who were taken to separate London hospitals in stable conditions. A prayer service was held in Drummer Rigby's hometown of Middleton, Greater Manchester, and residents are being urged to fly union jacks in his honor. The former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, Richard Barrett, expressed difficulty in detecting attacks like the one in Woolwich, as the suspects had no overseas connections or broader connections in the UK that could be detected by the security services.\n\nThe second passage reveals footage obtained by the Daily Mirror showing the suspects hatching a plot to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. The suspects lured the police to the scene by dragging the soldier's body into the middle of the road.

However, it is argued that this initiative's focus should shift towards encouraging girls to become leaders, particularly by exposing them to the C-Suite. The current state of women's representation in leadership roles is dismal, with women making up only a small percentage of CEOs, executive officers, and board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo address this issue, companies are encouraged to make several changes. First, they should introduce girls to female role models within the company, as seeing successful women in leadership roles can inspire girls and make leadership more tangible. Second, companies should clearly explain the responsibilities, rewards, and requirements of leadership roles to girls from a young age. This understanding can help them make informed decisions about their careers.\n\nThird, companies should implement proactive efforts to identify and groom female talent throughout the year. This can include encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, as was done at Princeton University, which saw a significant increase in the number of female Rhodes Scholars after implementing such a program.\n\nFinally, companies should provide sponsorship opportunities for women, as sponsors can provide valuable support and opportunities that mentors cannot. This can include advocating for women's careers and providing them with access to valuable networks and resources.\n\nThe importance of these changes is emphasized, as women's underrepresentation in leadership roles is costing companies talent, hurting the country's competitiveness, and undermining ideals of fairness and social equality.

The meeting, which was highly anticipated, was described as a personal encounter between the two leaders, with Trump expressing his eagerness for the discussion. The meeting was significant due to the ongoing tension between the two countries over issues such as Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and the ongoing investigations into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nThe meeting was held in a private setting, with only the two presidents, their foreign ministers, and two translators present. This was seen as a strategic move by Putin, as it would prevent any leaks, similar to what happened during Lavrov's visit to the White House in May. The length of the meeting, which ran over its scheduled time, was emphasized by Russian media as a sign of Russia's importance.\n\nTrump and Putin were filmed shaking hands at the summit, and the US president wrote on Twitter that he looked forward to the meeting and would represent the country well. However, Trump's stance on the Russian interference in the election was ambiguous, as he did not definitively confirm the US intelligence officials' claims.\n\nAhead of the meeting, three US senators expressed concern about reports that the US administration was considering the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York, which were seized by the Obama administration in response to alleged Russian election meddling. The senators warned that such a move would embolden Putin and encourage further Russian interference in Western elections.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled shortly after a G20 working session on climate and energy, which Trump was expected to leave early to make the Russia meeting.

{"pred": "In the frigid waters of Antarctica, a unique species of fish known as notothenioids have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in their icy environment. These proteins prevent the freezing of their blood and tissues, but a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has revealed a paradoxical trade-off: the same AFPs that inhibit ice growth also inhibit ice melting, leading to the accumulation of internal ice crystals.\n\nThe research, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, found that AFPs prevent ice from melting at temperatures above the expected melting point, even in laboratory experiments and in the natural environment. This superheated ice persists in the fish's bodies for extended periods, potentially causing long-term damage.\n\nThe study suggests that summer warming, which occurs in the Antarctic, may not be sufficient to rid the fish of internal ice, as the temperatures never exceed the highest temperature at which ice persists inside experimental fishes. This means that notothenioids carry ice crystals around in their veins for most of their lives, a risky proposition that could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams in small capillaries.\n\nThe team also found that the highest concentration of ice crystals resides in the fish's spleens, leading to the hypothesis that the spleen may be trying to filter out the ice crystals to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body. It is possible that the spleen has evolved a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation, but this remains unclear.\n\nThe discovery of this potentially antagonistic effect of AFPs exposes a complex aspect of the evolution of notothenioids. While the AFPs are essential for the fish's survival in their icy environment, they also come with a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. This study provides insights into the evolutionary puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the Antarctic waters and offers a broader understanding of the progression of evolution in all species, highlighting that every good evolutionary innovation may come with some potentially adverse consequences.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

{"pred": "The West Coast of North America is experiencing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that supports a diverse marine ecosystem. This decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, and overfishing. The decline in sardine population is causing concern for various species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that rely on sardines as a major food source.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. The decline in sardine population is also affecting the livelihood of commercial fishermen, with many reporting a significant decrease in catches.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is particularly concerning because sardines are a staple of the commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast. If the sardine population does not recover soon, experts warn that the West Coast's marine ecosystem could suffer for years, and fishermen could face long-term consequences.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is also causing concern for marine predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and other seabirds that rely on sardines for food. In 2013, 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego, with scientists attributing the malnourishment to a scarcity of prey, particularly sardines.\n\nThe sardine fishery has a history of volatility, with populations fluctuating widely. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. Geological records indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons.\n\nFor further information", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The film, which premieres this week, has been criticized for its portrayal of racial stereotypes and homophobic humor. During a Q&A session, audience members voiced concerns about the film's handling of racial stereotypes and its depiction of homosexuality. Critics have particularly taken issue with Ferrell's character's fear of being raped in prison, which includes a scene involving a gay man.\n\nThe film's creators, including director Ethan Cohen and stars Ferrell and Hart, have defended the movie as a satire, not a representation of stereotypes. Ferrell stated that the comedy provokes and prods, showing a mirror to existing attitudes and misconceptions. Hart added that the film explores the journey of two characters who, upon peeling back layers, realize their prejudices.\n\nThe comedy was written by Cohen, who has a history of writing for films like \"Idiocracy\" and \"Tropic Thunder.\" The humor, similar to \"Tropic Thunder,\" is intended to comment on contemporary issues of inequality and race within a broad, often crude comedy context. However, some critics argue that the film's humor is not offensive enough and is disappointing.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexa Internet, known for donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, continues its data donation.

This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions such as colds, flu, bronchitis, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nThe study found that 13% of all outpatient visits result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions being for acute respiratory conditions.

The study also highlighted that the majority of antibiotic use in the U.S. occurs in outpatient settings, making it crucial to address the issue of overuse in these settings.\n\nThe CDC and Pew have outlined strategies to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, including:\n1.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity use from the grid during peak demand by 65%, while south-facing panels reduced it by 54%.\n\nThe study's findings could significantly impact the residential solar market, as homeowners with west-facing roofs, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar due to their roof orientation, may now find their west-facing roofs to be a better location for solar panels. This could encourage more homeowners to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nThe study's results align with a 2011 California Public Utility Commission study, which also found that west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load compared to south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields.

The directive, signed in October 2012, details the use of Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO) and the potential consequences of such actions. The aim is to establish a framework for the government to make decisions on cyber actions, with a focus on effectiveness and risk assessment. The directive also addresses the possibility of cyber actions inside the US, with the president's approval required in certain cases.\n\n2. The Obama administration has been refining its use of offensive cyber operations to counter electronic assaults against the US. Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, stated that the directive signed by President Obama calls for government cyber tools to be integrated with other national security tools. This comes as President Obama is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with cybersecurity being one of the main topics of discussion.\n\n3.

Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost each year, according to a new study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since 2012 and contributes to a 0.6mm annual rise in global sea levels. The losses are predominantly occurring in the West Antarctica region, where warm ocean waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. The study, which incorporates data from 24 independent satellite assessments, indicates that Antarctica is becoming a significant contributor to sea-level rise.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the ice melts, the bedrock may lift up, potentially slowing the ice loss. However, this process is likely to be too slow to counteract the melting that has already occurred.\n\n3. The latest assessment of Antarctica's ice loss, as part of a series of assessments every several years, shows that the contribution of Antarctica to global sea-level rise is now tracking at the upper end of projections made by computer simulations. This means that sea levels are likely to rise by 50-60cm by 2100, posing a significant threat to coastal communities worldwide.\n\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctica's ice loss as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal areas.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

These actions have set the stage for a long-term legal battle over public land management in the United States.\n\nThe creation of the Bears Ears National Monument in 1996 by President Bill Clinton was also a contentious issue. The monument was established under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which grants the president executive powers to designate new monuments.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands.

{"pred": "In the news, there are two main stories revolving around Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain. The first story discusses the ongoing problems with overcrowding, unstable weather, and geography on Everest, which have led to numerous deaths and near-misses this season. The overcrowding is due to the increasing popularity of the mountain, with many amateur climbers attempting to reach the summit. One of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, Himalayan Experience (Himex), decided to cancel their climb this season due to unstable conditions, including dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening the trail, and an abundance of rockfall on the Lhotse Face. Despite Himex's departure, there are still around 700 climbers on the south side of the mountain, with a total body count of 11 so far, with more climbers preparing to make a summit bid on May 24-25.\n\nThe second story focuses on the risks and dangers faced by Sherpas, the ethnic group that makes up a significant portion of the climbing workforce on Everest. In an article from August 2013, it was found that the fatality rate for Sherpas working on Everest is much higher than traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation, and military combat. The death rate for Sherpas from 2000 to 2010 was 1,332 per 100,000 full-time equivalents, compared to 25 for miners, 124 for commercial fishermen, 287 for Alaskan bush pilots, and 335 for U.S. military personnel in Iraq from 2003 to 2007. However, since 2010, the number of Sherpa fatalities has increased significantly, with 4,053 deaths from 2010 to 2014. The article highlights the dangerous conditions that Sherpas face, including unstable ice, avalanches, and falling ice blocks, as well as the heavy loads they are required to carry and the lack of safety measures provided to them compared to Western climbers. The article also mentions that the Sherpa death rate has been decreasing for Western climbers", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4329}

The researchers, from the Czech Republic, used static facial photographs of 80 university students (40 men and 40 women) and had another 160 students rate the photographs for perceived intelligence or attractiveness. The results showed that men with higher IQ scores were perceived as more intelligent based on their facial photographs, while no such correlation was found for women.

The study suggests that people have an inbuilt ability to assess the intelligence of others, which could have important evolutionary consequences, but the exact reasons for this ability and why it does not work for women remain unclear.

The researchers have not yet directly observed the planet, but have inferred its existence from the motion of smaller objects in the outer solar system. If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the solar system's models and potentially rewrite the textbooks.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine comes after a decade of controversy surrounding Pluto's status as a planet. In 2006, Pluto was demoted from planet status by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) due to the discovery of larger objects in the Kuiper Belt, such as Eris, which were found to be more massive than Pluto. Mike Brown, one of the astronomers involved in the discovery of Eris, has been referred to as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in Pluto's demotion.\n\nBrown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, initially set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine, but their research led them to conclude that the best explanation for the clustering of smaller objects in the outer solar system was the gravitational influence of a much larger object. They used mathematical equations and computer models to support their hypothesis, and their paper builds on earlier research by Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo that suggested a potential ninth planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would be significant as it would provide a missing piece to the puzzle of the solar system's formation and evolution. The planet is thought to have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn, and its existence could help explain the motion of other objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, and telescopes on at least two continents are currently searching for the object. The planet is expected to be 20 times farther away from the sun than Neptune, making it extremely difficult to detect. If confirmed, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet in the solar system, after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

Damascus, the capital city of Syria, is experiencing a significant transformation due to the escalating war. Tensions have risen, and daily life has become increasingly dangerous, with frequent suicide bombings, kidnappings, and restrictions on movement due to checkpoints and closed roads. The city, once known for its vibrant party scene, is now a city under siege, with many people afraid to venture out after dark. The once-normal routine of daily life has been disrupted, and there is a sense of inevitability about the city's future.\n\n2. The ongoing battles between government forces and rebels are taking a heavy toll on cities across Syria. The fighting has led to widespread destruction, displacement, and loss of life. In Idlib and Aleppo provinces, airstrikes have killed at least 20 people and forced residents to dig through rubble for survivors. Additionally, oil and gas pipelines have been blown up, causing further economic disruption.\n\n3. The conflict is also affecting Syria's economy, particularly its business sector. Wealthy Syrians, who have traditionally supported President Bashar al-Assad, are seeing their businesses suffer due to the war. Factories have been damaged or destroyed, and international sanctions are restricting their finances. Many businesses are struggling to stay afloat, with some on the brink of collapse. The conflict has led to inflation, fuel shortages, and a sharp devaluation of the Syrian currency.\n\n4. The Alawite minority, a key support base for Assad, is facing challenges due to the conflict. Alawites, an obscure offshoot of Shiite Islam, have historically endured persecution and have relied on Assad's rule for protection. However, signs of unease within the community are emerging. There are rumors of discontent within the Assad family and tensions within the Alawite community itself. Some Alawites are questioning Assad's leadership and expressing concerns about their future if the rebels were to win.\n\nIn conclusion, the civil war in Syria is causing widespread suffering and disruption across the country.

Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the US, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-Western militias.

Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions.

The flyby will provide the first high-resolution images and data about Pluto, its moons, and its atmosphere.\n\nNew Horizons has already delivered data that has revealed Pluto to be larger than previously thought, with a diameter of 2,370 kilometers. This new measurement means that Pluto holds more ice and less rock beneath its surface than expected. The spacecraft has also detected methane and nitrogen ice in Pluto's polar cap.\n\nThe flyby will also provide insights into the solar system's early history, as Pluto is located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system that is a shooting gallery of comets and other small bodies. The data collected from Pluto could help refine theories about how water spread through the solar system and how life may have originated on Earth.\n\nThe flyby is a key moment in the history of space exploration, as it will complete the initial reconnaissance of the \"classical\" nine planets in our solar system.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

President Donald Trump called the verdict \"disgraceful\" and Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized San Francisco's sanctuary city policy, stating that it had led to the preventable death of Steinle. The jury did convict Garcia Zarate of being a felon in possession of a firearm, which could result in a three-year sentence.

This marks the first time since 1986 that the USMNT will not be participating in the World Cup. The loss was particularly devastating as the USMNT needed only a draw to secure a spot in the tournament.\n\nThe qualification process for the World Cup is a grueling one, with only three teams from the CONCACAF region (North, Central, and Caribbean) automatically qualifying. The USMNT, who were considered a lock for qualification, had a poor performance throughout the qualifying round, with only three wins in ten games. The loss to Trinidad and Tobago was the final nail in the coffin, as it allowed Panama and Honduras to clinch the final two spots.\n\nThe loss was particularly disappointing as it came on the heels of a 4-0 loss to Mexico and a 2-1 loss to Costa Rica, which put the USMNT in a precarious position.

The Zika virus is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which can lay eggs in standing water. The virus has been linked to birth defects, particularly microcephaly, and there is no vaccine or cure.\n\nIn Louisiana, the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center is facing a severe blood shortage due to the Zika virus and the summer vacation season. The center is urging people to donate blood to help meet local needs and fill the gap created by the Zika-related blood shortage. The center has also started testing for the Zika virus, but the Zika situation has affected their inventory due to travel restrictions for people who have been to Zika-affected areas.\n\nIn Florida, there have been 14 confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika virus, and the CDC is monitoring the situation closely. There is concern that the flooding in Louisiana could increase the risk of Zika, as the floodwaters could wash away mosquito eggs and then stimulate the hatching of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. However, experts are unsure if this will lead to an increase in the number of mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus.\n\nThe Zika virus has also been linked to an increase in other mosquito-borne illnesses, such as West Nile virus. Flooding can create breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which can increase in larger populations as the temperature and humidity rise.\n\nOverall, the news articles highlight the ongoing threat of the Zika virus and the need for continued monitoring and prevention efforts.

Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters.

The incident allegedly occurred at a nursing home where Donna was living. The prosecution's case is based on the argument that Donna lacked the mental capacity to consent due to her Alzheimer's. Donna passed away four days before her 79th birthday, and the prosecution argues that Rayhons took advantage of her confusion. However, Rayhons' family and friends claim that the couple were deeply in love and there is no evidence suggesting that Donna failed to recognize her husband or asked him not to touch her.\n\nThe case raises complex questions about consent and mental capacity in sexual relationships, particularly in cases where one partner has a permanent or long-lasting mental incapacity. The law in Iowa treats spouses differently, with spouses being allowed to have sex even if one partner is mentally incapacitated, but this privilege does not extend to unmarried partners. The law defines mental incapacity as temporary inability to consent due to the influence of drugs or intoxicants, but it does not take into account long-term or permanent incapacity.\n\nThe case highlights the need for the law to consider the nature of the parties' past relationship and long-term consent in such situations. It is argued that it is reasonable to determine whether someone would have consented based on past practice among the parties, especially in cases of long-lasting incapacity. The law's current approach criminalizes sexual touching of a mentally incapacitated person, even in situations where the touching is consensual based on past practice. This could potentially prevent spouses or long-term partners from giving or receiving pleasure from each other for many years, which could be a significant burden for those facing mental decline.\n\nThe case of Henry Rayhons is a rare example of a rape case involving a spouse with dementia, and it raises questions about how the law should handle such situations.
