The ferry, which was carrying approximately 170 passengers, was overloaded and appeared to sink within minutes, according to witnesses. Rescue operations were initiated by local firefighters, air force pilots, and other boats in the area. Survivors reported that those on the lower decks were unable to escape as the boat sank. The cause of the sinking is still unknown, but it is suspected that the boat was overloaded and no life vests were provided. The reservoir, located at El Penol, is a popular weekend destination and was particularly busy due to a holiday weekend. Authorities are seeking help from scuba divers and are asking for anyone with information to report to a rescue center.\n\nIn the second passage, there is no news content as it appears to be about a video rental service where the user is unable to rate a video until it has been rented and the rating feature is temporarily unavailable.", "answers": ["A tourist boat packed with about 160 passengers capsized Sunday on a reservoir near the Colombian city of Medellin, leaving at least six people dead and 31 missing, officials said. Rescuers including firefighters and air force pilots in helicopters searched for survivors at the Guatape reservoir where El Almirante ferry sank. A flotilla of recreational boats and jet skis rushed to the scene, pulling people from the boat as it went down and avoiding an even deadlier tragedy, the AP reports. Dramatic videos circulating on social media show the party boat rocking back and forth as people crawled down from a fourth-floor roof as it began sinking into the water. \"Those on the first and second floors sank immediately,\" a female survivor told Teleantioquia. \"The boat was sinking and all we could do was scream and call for help.\" Survivors described hearing a loud explosion near the men's bathroom that knocked out power a few minutes after the boat began its cruise around the lake. It's unclear what caused the boat to sink, but survivors said that it appeared to be overloaded and nobody on board was wearing a life vest. After arriving at the scene, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said 122 people were either rescued or found their way to shore, but six had died and another 31 were missing, he told reporters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 731}

However, shortly after her victory, a series of racial slurs on her Twitter account from several years ago resurfaced, causing an uproar on social media. In response, Hay acknowledged her past use of offensive language and expressed that she has since grown and changed, attributing her transformation to hard work, education, and the influence of the pageant sisterhood. The Miss Universe Organization, the parent company of Miss Teen USA, released a statement acknowledging the language Hay used was unacceptable but stated that she will be allowed to keep her crown and will continue to use her platform to promote positive values.\n\nChrissy Teigen, a model, commented on the pageant, jokingly pointing out the similarities in the looks of the top five finalists. Miss North Carolina Emily Wakeman, Miss Texas Karlie Hay, Miss South Carolina Marley Stokes, Miss Alabama Erin Snow, and Miss Nevada Carissa Morrow were the top five finalists, with Hay taking the crown. Hay plans to attend Texas A&M University after graduating from high school and hopes to become a businesswoman while advocating for people affected by drug and alcohol abuse.", "answers": ["Miss Teen USA 2016 was supposed to take a step in the direction of feminism and equal rights as the contest ditched the swimsuits for athletic wear. But in the wee hours following the event that crowned Miss Texas Karlie Hay, the 18-year-old high school senior took to Twitter to do damage control on, well, previous comments on social media. Accused of repeatedly using racial slurs, people began to take screenshots and call her out on it, reports the Houston Chronicle. Hay, her school's varsity cheer captain and yearbook editor, apologized on Twitter at 2am Sunday: \"I admit that I have used language publicly in the past which I am not proud of and that there is no excuse for. Through hard work, education and thanks in large part to the sisterhood that I have come to know through pageants, I am proud to say that I am today a better person.\" Former Miss Teen USA Kamie Crawford issued her own message on Twitter: \"If you win any pageant—first things first. Clean up your page. Because if you're under 21, you shouldn't be drinking and if you're white, the N-word ain't your word.\" The Miss Universe Organization, parent company of Miss Teen USA, tells ABC News that while Hay's language was \"unacceptable at any age,\" she will keep her crown because she \"learned many lessons through those personal struggles that reshaped her life and values.\" Meanwhile, E!

{"pred": "The news summarizes two documentaries and a biography that highlight the life and philanthropic work of Julius Rosenwald, a Jewish businessman and philanthropist from the early 20th century. Rosenwald, who made his fortune as the head of Sears, Roebuck and Co., was a significant contributor to African-American education and culture in the rural South. He provided funding for the building of over 5,300 schools for African-American children, many of which were named after him.\n\nThe documentaries \"Rosenwald\" by Aviva Kempner and the biography by Peter Ascoli bring to light Rosenwald's impact on African-American communities and his dedication to improving the lives of African-Americans. The films feature interviews with prominent African-Americans such as Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, all of whom attended Rosenwald schools as children.\n\nThe documentaries also highlight Rosenwald's personal and professional connections to Booker T. Washington, a prominent African-American leader at the time, and his influence on Rosenwald's philanthropic work. Rosenwald was deeply moved by Washington's teachings on the importance of education for African-Americans and was inspired to help provide opportunities for black children to attend school.\n\nThe films also touch on the parallels Rosenwald drew between the violence against Jews in Europe and the violence against African-Americans in America, and his commitment to fighting for racial equality. Rosenwald's philanthropy extended beyond education, as he also provided funding for YMCAs for African-Americans and supported the arts.\n\nThe documentaries and biography serve as a testament to Rosenwald's legacy as a philanthropist and his commitment to improving the lives of African-Americans. They also serve as a reminder of the importance of philanthropy and the power of giving back to the community. The films are set to be released in theaters in the coming months.", "answers": ["Julius Rosenwald is well known as the 20th-century American businessman who co-founded what we now call Sears. But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says. More than 80 years after his death, Rosenwald still inspires. \"Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\" says Kempner, but \"we can all do something.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2028}
