He provided funding for the building of over 5,300 schools for African-American children, many of which were named after him.\n\nThe documentaries \"Rosenwald\" by Aviva Kempner and the biography by Peter Ascoli bring to light Rosenwald's impact on African-American communities and his dedication to improving the lives of African-Americans. The films feature interviews with prominent African-Americans such as Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, all of whom attended Rosenwald schools as children.\n\nThe documentaries also highlight Rosenwald's personal and professional connections to Booker T.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The UK government is facing criticism for missing signs that could have prevented the murder, but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles defends the security services, stating it is impossible to control everyone in a free society. Drummer Rigby, a 25-year-old soldier who served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus, was murdered in a street in Woolwich, south-east London. The suspects were filmed by a passerby, with Adebolajo stating they carried out the attack because British soldiers kill Muslims every day. Armed police arrived on the scene 13 minutes after the first 999 call and shot the two suspects, who were taken to separate London hospitals in stable conditions. A prayer service was held in Drummer Rigby's hometown of Middleton, Greater Manchester, and residents are being urged to fly union jacks in his honor. The former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, Richard Barrett, expressed difficulty in detecting attacks like the one in Woolwich, as the suspects had no overseas connections or broader connections in the UK that could be detected by the security services.\n\nThe second passage reveals footage obtained by the Daily Mirror showing the suspects hatching a plot to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. The suspects lured the police to the scene by dragging the soldier's body into the middle of the road.

However, it is argued that this initiative's focus should shift towards encouraging girls to become leaders, particularly by exposing them to the C-Suite. The current state of women's representation in leadership roles is dismal, with women making up only a small percentage of CEOs, executive officers, and board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo address this issue, companies are encouraged to make several changes. First, they should introduce girls to female role models within the company, as seeing successful women in leadership roles can inspire girls and make leadership more tangible. Second, companies should clearly explain the responsibilities, rewards, and requirements of leadership roles to girls from a young age. This understanding can help them make informed decisions about their careers.\n\nThird, companies should implement proactive efforts to identify and groom female talent throughout the year. This can include encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, as was done at Princeton University, which saw a significant increase in the number of female Rhodes Scholars after implementing such a program.\n\nFinally, companies should provide sponsorship opportunities for women, as sponsors can provide valuable support and opportunities that mentors cannot. This can include advocating for women's careers and providing them with access to valuable networks and resources.\n\nThe importance of these changes is emphasized, as women's underrepresentation in leadership roles is costing companies talent, hurting the country's competitiveness, and undermining ideals of fairness and social equality.

The meeting, which was highly anticipated, was described as a personal encounter between the two leaders, with Trump expressing his eagerness for the discussion. The meeting was significant due to the ongoing tension between the two countries over issues such as Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and the ongoing investigations into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nThe meeting was held in a private setting, with only the two presidents, their foreign ministers, and two translators present. This was seen as a strategic move by Putin, as it would prevent any leaks, similar to what happened during Lavrov's visit to the White House in May. The length of the meeting, which ran over its scheduled time, was emphasized by Russian media as a sign of Russia's importance.\n\nTrump and Putin were filmed shaking hands at the summit, and the US president wrote on Twitter that he looked forward to the meeting and would represent the country well. However, Trump's stance on the Russian interference in the election was ambiguous, as he did not definitively confirm the US intelligence officials' claims.\n\nAhead of the meeting, three US senators expressed concern about reports that the US administration was considering the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York, which were seized by the Obama administration in response to alleged Russian election meddling. The senators warned that such a move would embolden Putin and encourage further Russian interference in Western elections.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled shortly after a G20 working session on climate and energy, which Trump was expected to leave early to make the Russia meeting.

The rape complainant, who told a hearing last year that she hated herself and considered suicide after Camp's comments, said the council's decision made her feel a lot more hopeful about the justice system."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2879}

The news serves as a reminder of the importance of voting and the influence celebrities can have in encouraging others to participate in the democratic process.", "answers": ["Justin Timberlake rocked the vote Monday in Memphis, but he could soon be rocking a prison cell thanks to a Tennessee law that prohibits taking pictures or videos inside polling stations, TMZ reports. According to CNN, the superstar flew to his hometown Monday to vote, taking a selfie in front of the Diebold voting machine in the process. Timberlake posted the photo to Instagram with the caption: \"Choose to have a voice! If you don't, then we can't HEAR YOU! Get out and VOTE!\" Now he could face 30 days in jail and/or a $50 fine. The local district attorney's office says the incident is \"under review.\" The Tennessee legislature passed the law banning the taking of photos and videos in polling stations in 2015, the Commercial Appeal reports. Timberlake would be the first person prosecuted under the new law. In addition to voting and possibly breaking a law, Timberlake posed for photos outside the polling station at the New Bethel Missionary Baptist Church. Local school board candidate Suzanne Jones posted hers to Twitter. \"I said, 'I know you’ve done it a lot, but I’d appreciate a picture with you,'\" Jones tells the Commercial Appeal. \"Someone was going to take it for me. But he said, 'No, I can take it. I do have gorilla arms, since I do this a lot.'\" Timberlake lives in Los Angeles and owns property in Nashville but is still registered to vote in Memphis.

{"pred": "In the frigid waters of Antarctica, a unique species of fish known as notothenioids have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in their icy environment. These proteins prevent the freezing of their blood and tissues, but a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has revealed a paradoxical trade-off: the same AFPs that inhibit ice growth also inhibit ice melting, leading to the accumulation of internal ice crystals.\n\nThe research, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, found that AFPs prevent ice from melting at temperatures above the expected melting point, even in laboratory experiments and in the natural environment. This superheated ice persists in the fish's bodies for extended periods, potentially causing long-term damage.\n\nThe study suggests that summer warming, which occurs in the Antarctic, may not be sufficient to rid the fish of internal ice, as the temperatures never exceed the highest temperature at which ice persists inside experimental fishes. This means that notothenioids carry ice crystals around in their veins for most of their lives, a risky proposition that could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams in small capillaries.\n\nThe team also found that the highest concentration of ice crystals resides in the fish's spleens, leading to the hypothesis that the spleen may be trying to filter out the ice crystals to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body. It is possible that the spleen has evolved a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation, but this remains unclear.\n\nThe discovery of this potentially antagonistic effect of AFPs exposes a complex aspect of the evolution of notothenioids. While the AFPs are essential for the fish's survival in their icy environment, they also come with a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. This study provides insights into the evolutionary puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the Antarctic waters and offers a broader understanding of the progression of evolution in all species, highlighting that every good evolutionary innovation may come with some potentially adverse consequences.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}
