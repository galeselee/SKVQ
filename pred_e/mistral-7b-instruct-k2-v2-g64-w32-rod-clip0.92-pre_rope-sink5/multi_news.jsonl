He provided funding for the building of over 5,300 schools for African-American children, many of which were named after him.\n\nThe documentaries \"Rosenwald\" by Aviva Kempner and the biography by Peter Ascoli bring to light Rosenwald's impact on African-American communities and his dedication to improving the lives of African-Americans. The films feature interviews with prominent African-Americans such as Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, all of whom attended Rosenwald schools as children.\n\nThe documentaries also highlight Rosenwald's personal and professional connections to Booker T.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The UK government is facing criticism for missing signs that could have prevented the murder, but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles defends the security services, stating it is impossible to control everyone in a free society. Drummer Rigby, a 25-year-old soldier who served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus, was murdered in a street in Woolwich, south-east London. The suspects were filmed by a passerby, with Adebolajo stating they carried out the attack because British soldiers kill Muslims every day. Armed police arrived on the scene 13 minutes after the first 999 call and shot the two suspects, who were taken to separate London hospitals in stable conditions. A prayer service was held in Drummer Rigby's hometown of Middleton, Greater Manchester, and residents are being urged to fly union jacks in his honor. The former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, Richard Barrett, expressed difficulty in detecting attacks like the one in Woolwich, as the suspects had no overseas connections or broader connections in the UK that could be detected by the security services.\n\nThe second passage reveals footage obtained by the Daily Mirror showing the suspects hatching a plot to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. The suspects lured the police to the scene by dragging the soldier's body into the middle of the road.

However, it is argued that this initiative's focus should shift towards encouraging girls to become leaders, particularly by exposing them to the C-Suite. The current state of women's representation in leadership roles is dismal, with women making up only a small percentage of CEOs, executive officers, and board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo address this issue, companies are encouraged to make several changes. First, they should introduce girls to female role models within the company, as seeing successful women in leadership roles can inspire girls and make leadership more tangible. Second, companies should clearly explain the responsibilities, rewards, and requirements of leadership roles to girls from a young age. This understanding can help them make informed decisions about their careers.\n\nThird, companies should implement proactive efforts to identify and groom female talent throughout the year. This can include encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, as was done at Princeton University, which saw a significant increase in the number of female Rhodes Scholars after implementing such a program.\n\nFinally, companies should provide sponsorship opportunities for women, as sponsors can provide valuable support and opportunities that mentors cannot. This can include advocating for women's careers and providing them with access to valuable networks and resources.\n\nThe importance of these changes is emphasized, as women's underrepresentation in leadership roles is costing companies talent, hurting the country's competitiveness, and undermining ideals of fairness and social equality.

The meeting, which was highly anticipated, was described as a personal encounter between the two leaders, with Trump expressing his eagerness for the discussion. The meeting was significant due to the ongoing tension between the two countries over issues such as Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and the ongoing investigations into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nThe meeting was held in a private setting, with only the two presidents, their foreign ministers, and two translators present. This was seen as a strategic move by Putin, as it would prevent any leaks, similar to what happened during Lavrov's visit to the White House in May. The length of the meeting, which ran over its scheduled time, was emphasized by Russian media as a sign of Russia's importance.\n\nTrump and Putin were filmed shaking hands at the summit, and the US president wrote on Twitter that he looked forward to the meeting and would represent the country well. However, Trump's stance on the Russian interference in the election was ambiguous, as he did not definitively confirm the US intelligence officials' claims.\n\nAhead of the meeting, three US senators expressed concern about reports that the US administration was considering the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York, which were seized by the Obama administration in response to alleged Russian election meddling. The senators warned that such a move would embolden Putin and encourage further Russian interference in Western elections.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled shortly after a G20 working session on climate and energy, which Trump was expected to leave early to make the Russia meeting.

{"pred": "In the frigid waters of Antarctica, a unique species of fish known as notothenioids have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in their icy environment. These proteins prevent the freezing of their blood and tissues, but a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has revealed a paradoxical trade-off: the same AFPs that inhibit ice growth also inhibit ice melting, leading to the accumulation of internal ice crystals.\n\nThe research, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, found that AFPs prevent ice from melting at temperatures above the expected melting point, even in laboratory experiments and in the natural environment. This superheated ice persists in the fish's bodies for extended periods, potentially causing long-term damage.\n\nThe study suggests that summer warming, which occurs in the Antarctic, may not be sufficient to rid the fish of internal ice, as the temperatures never exceed the highest temperature at which ice persists inside experimental fishes. This means that notothenioids carry ice crystals around in their veins for most of their lives, a risky proposition that could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams in small capillaries.\n\nThe team also found that the highest concentration of ice crystals resides in the fish's spleens, leading to the hypothesis that the spleen may be trying to filter out the ice crystals to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body. It is possible that the spleen has evolved a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation, but this remains unclear.\n\nThe discovery of this potentially antagonistic effect of AFPs exposes a complex aspect of the evolution of notothenioids. While the AFPs are essential for the fish's survival in their icy environment, they also come with a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. This study provides insights into the evolutionary puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the Antarctic waters and offers a broader understanding of the progression of evolution in all species, highlighting that every good evolutionary innovation may come with some potentially adverse consequences.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

{"pred": "The West Coast of North America is experiencing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that supports a diverse marine ecosystem. This decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, and overfishing. The decline in sardine population is causing concern for various species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that rely on sardines as a major food source.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. The decline in sardine population is also affecting the livelihood of commercial fishermen, with many reporting a significant decrease in catches.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is particularly concerning because sardines are a staple of the commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast. If the sardine population does not recover soon, experts warn that the West Coast's marine ecosystem could suffer for years, and fishermen could face long-term consequences.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is also causing concern for marine predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and other seabirds that rely on sardines for food. In 2013, 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego, with scientists attributing the malnourishment to a scarcity of prey, particularly sardines.\n\nThe sardine fishery has a history of volatility, with populations fluctuating widely. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. Geological records indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons.\n\nFor further information", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The film, which premieres this week, has been criticized for its portrayal of racial stereotypes and homophobic humor. During a Q&A session, audience members voiced concerns about the film's handling of racial stereotypes and its depiction of homosexuality. Critics have particularly taken issue with Ferrell's character's fear of being raped in prison, which includes a scene involving a gay man.\n\nThe film's creators, including director Ethan Cohen and stars Ferrell and Hart, have defended the movie as a satire, not a representation of stereotypes. Ferrell stated that the comedy provokes and prods, showing a mirror to existing attitudes and misconceptions. Hart added that the film explores the journey of two characters who, upon peeling back layers, realize their prejudices.\n\nThe comedy was written by Cohen, who has a history of writing for films like \"Idiocracy\" and \"Tropic Thunder.\" The humor, similar to \"Tropic Thunder,\" is intended to comment on contemporary issues of inequality and race within a broad, often crude comedy context. However, some critics argue that the film's humor is not offensive enough and is disappointing.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexa Internet, known for donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, continues its data donation.

This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions such as colds, flu, bronchitis, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nThe study found that 13% of all outpatient visits result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions being for acute respiratory conditions.

The study also highlighted that the majority of antibiotic use in the U.S. occurs in outpatient settings, making it crucial to address the issue of overuse in these settings.\n\nThe CDC and Pew have outlined strategies to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, including:\n1.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity use from the grid during peak demand by 65%, while south-facing panels reduced it by 54%.\n\nThe study's findings could significantly impact the residential solar market, as homeowners with west-facing roofs, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar due to their roof orientation, may now find their west-facing roofs to be a better location for solar panels. This could encourage more homeowners to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nThe study's results align with a 2011 California Public Utility Commission study, which also found that west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load compared to south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields.

The directive, signed in October 2012, details the use of Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO) and the potential consequences of such actions. The aim is to establish a framework for the government to make decisions on cyber actions, with a focus on effectiveness and risk assessment. The directive also addresses the possibility of cyber actions inside the US, with the president's approval required in certain cases.\n\n2. The Obama administration has been refining its use of offensive cyber operations to counter electronic assaults against the US. Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, stated that the directive signed by President Obama calls for government cyber tools to be integrated with other national security tools. This comes as President Obama is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with cybersecurity being one of the main topics of discussion.\n\n3.

Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost each year, according to a new study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since 2012 and contributes to a 0.6mm annual rise in global sea levels. The losses are predominantly occurring in the West Antarctica region, where warm ocean waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. The study, which incorporates data from 24 independent satellite assessments, indicates that Antarctica is becoming a significant contributor to sea-level rise.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the ice melts, the bedrock may lift up, potentially slowing the ice loss. However, this process is likely to be too slow to counteract the melting that has already occurred.\n\n3. The latest assessment of Antarctica's ice loss, as part of a series of assessments every several years, shows that the contribution of Antarctica to global sea-level rise is now tracking at the upper end of projections made by computer simulations. This means that sea levels are likely to rise by 50-60cm by 2100, posing a significant threat to coastal communities worldwide.\n\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctica's ice loss as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal areas.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

These actions have set the stage for a long-term legal battle over public land management in the United States.\n\nThe creation of the Bears Ears National Monument in 1996 by President Bill Clinton was also a contentious issue. The monument was established under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which grants the president executive powers to designate new monuments.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands.

{"pred": "In the news, there are two main stories revolving around Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain. The first story discusses the ongoing problems with overcrowding, unstable weather, and geography on Everest, which have led to numerous deaths and near-misses this season. The overcrowding is due to the increasing popularity of the mountain, with many amateur climbers attempting to reach the summit. One of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, Himalayan Experience (Himex), decided to cancel their climb this season due to unstable conditions, including dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening the trail, and an abundance of rockfall on the Lhotse Face. Despite Himex's departure, there are still around 700 climbers on the south side of the mountain, with a total body count of 11 so far, with more climbers preparing to make a summit bid on May 24-25.\n\nThe second story focuses on the risks and dangers faced by Sherpas, the ethnic group that makes up a significant portion of the climbing workforce on Everest. In an article from August 2013, it was found that the fatality rate for Sherpas working on Everest is much higher than traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation, and military combat. The death rate for Sherpas from 2000 to 2010 was 1,332 per 100,000 full-time equivalents, compared to 25 for miners, 124 for commercial fishermen, 287 for Alaskan bush pilots, and 335 for U.S. military personnel in Iraq from 2003 to 2007. However, since 2010, the number of Sherpa fatalities has increased significantly, with 4,053 deaths from 2010 to 2014. The article highlights the dangerous conditions that Sherpas face, including unstable ice, avalanches, and falling ice blocks, as well as the heavy loads they are required to carry and the lack of safety measures provided to them compared to Western climbers. The article also mentions that the Sherpa death rate has been decreasing for Western climbers", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4329}

The researchers, from the Czech Republic, used static facial photographs of 80 university students (40 men and 40 women) and had another 160 students rate the photographs for perceived intelligence or attractiveness. The results showed that men with higher IQ scores were perceived as more intelligent based on their facial photographs, while no such correlation was found for women.

The study suggests that people have an inbuilt ability to assess the intelligence of others, which could have important evolutionary consequences, but the exact reasons for this ability and why it does not work for women remain unclear.

The researchers have not yet directly observed the planet, but have inferred its existence from the motion of smaller objects in the outer solar system. If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the solar system's models and potentially rewrite the textbooks.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine comes after a decade of controversy surrounding Pluto's status as a planet. In 2006, Pluto was demoted from planet status by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) due to the discovery of larger objects in the Kuiper Belt, such as Eris, which were found to be more massive than Pluto. Mike Brown, one of the astronomers involved in the discovery of Eris, has been referred to as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in Pluto's demotion.\n\nBrown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, initially set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine, but their research led them to conclude that the best explanation for the clustering of smaller objects in the outer solar system was the gravitational influence of a much larger object. They used mathematical equations and computer models to support their hypothesis, and their paper builds on earlier research by Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo that suggested a potential ninth planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would be significant as it would provide a missing piece to the puzzle of the solar system's formation and evolution. The planet is thought to have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn, and its existence could help explain the motion of other objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, and telescopes on at least two continents are currently searching for the object. The planet is expected to be 20 times farther away from the sun than Neptune, making it extremely difficult to detect. If confirmed, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet in the solar system, after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

Damascus, the capital city of Syria, is experiencing a significant transformation due to the escalating war. Tensions have risen, and daily life has become increasingly dangerous, with frequent suicide bombings, kidnappings, and restrictions on movement due to checkpoints and closed roads. The city, once known for its vibrant party scene, is now a city under siege, with many people afraid to venture out after dark. The once-normal routine of daily life has been disrupted, and there is a sense of inevitability about the city's future.\n\n2. The ongoing battles between government forces and rebels are taking a heavy toll on cities across Syria. The fighting has led to widespread destruction, displacement, and loss of life. In Idlib and Aleppo provinces, airstrikes have killed at least 20 people and forced residents to dig through rubble for survivors. Additionally, oil and gas pipelines have been blown up, causing further economic disruption.\n\n3. The conflict is also affecting Syria's economy, particularly its business sector. Wealthy Syrians, who have traditionally supported President Bashar al-Assad, are seeing their businesses suffer due to the war. Factories have been damaged or destroyed, and international sanctions are restricting their finances. Many businesses are struggling to stay afloat, with some on the brink of collapse. The conflict has led to inflation, fuel shortages, and a sharp devaluation of the Syrian currency.\n\n4. The Alawite minority, a key support base for Assad, is facing challenges due to the conflict. Alawites, an obscure offshoot of Shiite Islam, have historically endured persecution and have relied on Assad's rule for protection. However, signs of unease within the community are emerging. There are rumors of discontent within the Assad family and tensions within the Alawite community itself. Some Alawites are questioning Assad's leadership and expressing concerns about their future if the rebels were to win.\n\nIn conclusion, the civil war in Syria is causing widespread suffering and disruption across the country.

Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the US, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-Western militias.

Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions.

The flyby will provide the first high-resolution images and data about Pluto, its moons, and its atmosphere.\n\nNew Horizons has already delivered data that has revealed Pluto to be larger than previously thought, with a diameter of 2,370 kilometers. This new measurement means that Pluto holds more ice and less rock beneath its surface than expected. The spacecraft has also detected methane and nitrogen ice in Pluto's polar cap.\n\nThe flyby will also provide insights into the solar system's early history, as Pluto is located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system that is a shooting gallery of comets and other small bodies. The data collected from Pluto could help refine theories about how water spread through the solar system and how life may have originated on Earth.\n\nThe flyby is a key moment in the history of space exploration, as it will complete the initial reconnaissance of the \"classical\" nine planets in our solar system.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

The loss was particularly devastating as the USMNT needed only a draw to secure a spot in the tournament.\n\nThe qualification process for the World Cup is a grueling one, with only three teams from the CONCACAF region (North, Central, and Caribbean) automatically qualifying.

Donna passed away four days before her 79th birthday, and the prosecution argues that Rayhons took advantage of her confusion. However, Rayhons' family and friends claim that the couple were deeply in love and there is no evidence suggesting that Donna failed to recognize her husband or asked him not to touch her.\n\nThe case raises complex questions about consent and mental capacity in sexual relationships, particularly in cases where one partner has a permanent or long-lasting mental incapacity. The law in Iowa treats spouses differently, with spouses being allowed to have sex even if one partner is mentally incapacitated, but this privilege does not extend to unmarried partners. The law defines mental incapacity as temporary inability to consent due to the influence of drugs or intoxicants, but it does not take into account long-term or permanent incapacity.\n\nThe case highlights the need for the law to consider the nature of the parties' past relationship and long-term consent in such situations. It is argued that it is reasonable to determine whether someone would have consented based on past practice among the parties, especially in cases of long-lasting incapacity. The law's current approach criminalizes sexual touching of a mentally incapacitated person, even in situations where the touching is consensual based on past practice. This could potentially prevent spouses or long-term partners from giving or receiving pleasure from each other for many years, which could be a significant burden for those facing mental decline.\n\nThe case of Henry Rayhons is a rare example of a rape case involving a spouse with dementia, and it raises questions about how the law should handle such situations.

The hearing, which is expected to last four days, was disrupted by protesters who were removed by police. Democrats, including potential 2020 presidential candidates, demanded a delay in the hearing due to the late release of Kavanaugh's documents from his time in the George W. Bush White House. Republicans, however, accused Democrats of politicizing the process and re-litigating the 2016 election.\n\nKavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, sat silently for seven hours as senators spoke, eventually addressing the committee later in the day. In his statement, Kavanaugh emphasized his commitment to being a neutral and impartial arbiter, and his belief in the importance of the independence of the judiciary. He also expressed his appreciation for the strides women have made in professional and athletic fields, a likely attempt to counter criticism that his confirmation could be detrimental to women's reproductive rights and health care options.\n\nThe hearing is expected to continue on Wednesday with questioning from senators. Democrats have signaled their intention to press Kavanaugh on his views on contentious legal questions, particularly Roe v. Wade, while Republicans have expressed confidence in his confirmation. The Republican-controlled Senate can confirm Kavanaugh with a simple majority vote, though Democrats lack the power to delay the process.\n\nThe hearing has been marked by intense political tension, with Democrats accusing Republicans of withholding documents and Republicans accusing Democrats of obstructing the process. The hearing has also been a show of force by Democrats weighing 2020 presidential campaigns, as they seek to counter Trump's presidency and appeal to activists. Trump himself tweeted his criticism of the Democrats' opposition to Kavanaugh, calling it a \"display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is.\"\n\nIn the background, the Senate Judiciary Committee is also considering the nomination of Jon Kyl, a former senator, to fill the seat left vacant by the late John McCain.

The event aims to bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions to improve the design and technology of breast pumps. The goal is to make the act of pumping less awkward, more efficient, and more user-friendly.\n\nThe current breast pump design has several problems, including a loud motor, multiple parts that are hard to clean, the inability to lay down while pumping, difficulty keeping track of pumped milk, and the stigma associated with breast milk and breastfeeding. The hackathon aims to address these issues and make breast pumping more accessible and acceptable for working mothers.\n\nThe hackathon was inspired by the lack of innovation in the breast pump industry, which has not seen significant changes since the 1920s. The event seeks to catalyze innovation in maternal and pediatric health and create a more supportive environment for families.\n\nSome possible innovations include smarter interfaces and guided experiences, data collection, and hands-free wearable pumps. The hackathon will also focus on policy changes to ensure that women have access to private spaces to pump during the workday.\n\nThe hackathon is open to the public, and ideas can still be submitted even if one cannot attend the event. The winning team will receive a $3,000 prize, a trip to Silicon Valley to pitch their idea to investors, and other prizes for outstanding user-focused design. The event is sponsored by several companies, including Vecna Technologies, Medela, Naia Health, and Moxxly.\n\nThe breast pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum, as women are expected to balance their careers with their desire to breastfeed their babies.

Snowden's actions have sparked a diplomatic crisis, with the U.S. expressing frustration over Hong Kong's decision to allow him to leave despite the U.S. request for his detention. The U.S. has accused China and Russia of potentially aiding Snowden in his escape, and there have been reports that he may have been on a flight to Cuba on Monday but did not show up. WikiLeaks, which has been advising Snowden, has claimed that he is in a \"safe place\" and his spirits are high. Snowden's leaks revealed the vast collection of phone and Internet data obtained by the NSA and other intelligence groups, and he has been charged with espionage. The U.S. has requested the cooperation of Russia and other countries to return Snowden for prosecution, but it is unclear if they will comply. The episode has reverberated globally, with countries exploiting the opportunity to flout American will and demonstrate their ability to protect civil liberties.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.

The funding freeze is seen as a response to the Palestinian Authority's suspension of contacts with the Trump administration following the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

First, it was released during a crowded summer season with numerous other high-profile films, such as \"Finding Dory\" and \"The Legend of Tarzan.\" Second, the title \"The BFG\" may have been confusing to audiences, as the acronym is not immediately recognizable. Third, the film lacked big-name stars, with Mark Rylance, while an award-winning actor, not being a box office draw. Fourth, the giant character in the film may have appeared more scary than friendly, which may have deterred families from attending. Lastly, the film's release was poorly timed, as it was released during a holiday weekend when many families were on vacation or spending time with their families.\n\nDespite the film's disappointing performance domestically, it is hoped that it will perform better overseas. The film has already opened in Australia and Russia, earning $2 million and $1.9 million respectively, and will continue to be released in other territories.\n\nThe underperformance of \"The BFG\" is significant because it marks a rare box office flop for Steven Spielberg, who has a long and successful track record in the film industry. It is also significant because it is the first such flop in a long time (if ever) for a film intended as a commercial crowd-pleaser. This raises questions about the appeal of such films and whether audiences are no longer as interested in the type of popcorn entertainment that Spielberg is known for.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The US launched 59 Tomahawk missiles from two warships in the Mediterranean Sea, targeting the airfield's runways, hangars, control tower, and ammunition areas. The US claims that the airbase was used to launch the chemical attack.\n\nThe strike was condemned by Russia, which called it an \"aggression\" and suspended a memorandum with Washington on exchanging information about sorties over Syria. Russia's Foreign Ministry also demanded an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the matter. Russia's President Vladimir Putin believes the US strike was a result of a \"far-fetched pretext\" and will create a \"serious obstacle\" for creating an international coalition against terrorism.\n\nWorld leaders, including France, Germany, and the UK, have expressed support for the US action, while some, such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, have called for the removal of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

The White House believes that such legislation would hinder ongoing negotiations with Iran and undermine the efforts of U.S. negotiators. The bill would require the submission of any agreement within five days of its conclusion and prohibit the President from suspending or waiving sanctions on Iran for 60 days.\n\n2. Tensions between the United States and Israel have escalated ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress, where he is expected to warn against a potential nuclear deal with Iran. The speech has caused a rift between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama, with the White House expressing concern that it could jeopardize the ongoing nuclear talks. Israel fears that a deal with Iran could lead to the development of nuclear weapons, while the U.S. seeks to prevent this outcome through diplomatic means.\n\n3. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern over Iran's slow cooperation with its investigation into Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA is investigating allegations that Iran has conducted tests using explosives that could be used for nuclear bomb research, but Iran has yet to address these issues satisfactorily. The IAEA's inquiry is ongoing and cannot continue indefinitely, according to IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano.\n\n4.

The website offers real-time counseling to help women use misoprostol, a drug that can cause a miscarriage, safely and effectively. The counselors are trained by medical professionals to guide women through the process and may also connect them with abortion funds if payment is the main obstacle.\n\nThe project has been inspired by the stories of women who have already been taking matters into their own hands, particularly those living along the US-Mexico border, where misoprostol, a drug that can be purchased over the counter in Central American pharmacies, is used. The legal risks of self-administering misoprostol are complicated, but the act of seeking information about self-induced abortion is protected by law. However, the project could potentially compound the risk of prosecution.\n\nThe act of self-induced abortions is a significant, albeit hidden, phenomenon in the US, with studies suggesting that many women attempt to induce their own abortions without medical supervision. The number of women doing so may be on the rise due to limited access to clinics and the high cost of abortions.\n\nThe news also highlights the story of Martina, a woman in Texas who, unable to afford an abortion, sought help from Women Help Women and eventually traveled to Mexico to purchase misoprostol. The story serves as a reminder of the real-life consequences of abortion restrictions and the desperation that some women face when they cannot access safe and legal abortion services.\n\nThe news also includes information about the safe and effective use of misoprostol for self-induced abortions, including dosage, timing, and what to expect after taking the pills. It is important to note that this information is for informational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for advice from a medical provider.

Walker's exit marks the second major departure from the Republican presidential race, following former Texas Governor Rick Perry's withdrawal in early September.\n\nWalker's campaign had initially gained momentum due to his success in battling public unions in his home state and his reputation as a conservative outsider. However, his poll numbers plummeted as Donald Trump rose to the front-runner position, and Walker struggled to compete with the more popular non-politician candidates such as Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina. Walker's campaign was also hampered by self-inflicted wounds, including inconsistent positions on issues such as birthright citizenship and evolution.\n\nWalker's departure leaves the Republican field with 15 candidates, including Trump, Carson, Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz. Some analysts suggest that Walker's exit could benefit Rubio, who shares a similar appeal as a fresh face and next-generation conservative. Walker's supporters are now being courted by other campaigns, and the Ricketts family, a major Republican donor, is expected to support another candidate.\n\nWalker's decision to leave the race was met with mixed reactions. Some Republican opponents offered kind words, while liberal groups criticized Walker's record on labor and unions.

Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border.

The race was marked by controversy, with Hyde-Smith's comment about attending a \"public hanging\" if invited by a supporter, which was seen as a reference to the state's history of lynchings.\n\nHyde-Smith's comment sparked a national outcry and fueled Democratic hopes of an upset in a state where 38% of the population is black. However, she managed to depict Espy as too liberal for Mississippi and touted her support for President Donald Trump, who held two get-out-the-vote rallies for her on Monday. Trump tweeted his congratulations to Hyde-Smith after the race was called.\n\nEspy campaigned as a moderate who would work with Republicans and Trump to benefit the state. He tried to energize black voters, particularly women, and win over white swing voters, similar to the coalition that propelled Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate win in neighboring Alabama last year. However, Espy was unable to overcome the Republican advantage in the state, which has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982.\n\nSeveral businesses, including Walmart, had demanded Hyde-Smith return their donations after her \"public hanging\" comment. Hyde-Smith initially refused to apologize but later said she was sorry \"for anyone that was offended.\" She accused Espy of twisting her words for political gain.\n\nThe runoff was necessary because neither Hyde-Smith nor Espy gained more than 50% of the vote in the initial special election held on November 6. The seat was vacated by longtime Republican Senator Thad Cochran, who resigned due to health concerns. Cochran had been in office since 1978.", "answers": ["Will it be 53-47 or 52-48?

As Politico reports, Hyde-Pierce has never trailed in the polls and continues to be the favorite to win, but a string of controversies—starting with her joke about a public hanging—has given Espy a bigger-than-expected shot at becoming the state's first black senator since Reconstruction. \"A wounded front-runner\" is how a political science professor in Jackson describes Hyde-Smith to Reuters. President Trump easily won the state in 2016, and he held two rallies there Monday for his fellow Republican. \"Her heart is good,\" Trump said of Hyde-Smith, per CNN. Trump called her controversial joke \"sad and a little flip,\" but he defended her explanation that it was meant as a good-natured way of praising a supporter. \"When I spoke to her—she called me—she said, 'I said something that I meant exactly very different,' and I heard an apology loud and clear,\" Trump said. As for Espy: \"How does he fit in with Mississippi?\" the president asked, as noted by CNBC. \"I mean, how does he fit in?\" The website FiveThirtyEight reports that a survey last week had Hyde-Smith up 54% to 44%.

Plural marriage, the practice of one man being married to multiple women, was instituted by Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, after receiving a revelation from God. This practice was controversial and violated cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and revilement.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced incrementally and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. The historical record of early plural marriage is thin due to the lack of detailed records and the passage of time. The Church acknowledges the challenges and difficulties experienced by those who practiced plural marriage, including the emotional toll it took on Joseph Smith's wife, Emma.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was justified as a means of increasing the number of children born in the faith and as a way to create eternal family bonds. Plural marriage resulted in the birth of large numbers of children within Latter-day Saint families and helped to unite a diverse immigrant population. It also helped to create a sense of cohesion and group identity among Latter-day Saints, who saw themselves as a \"peculiar people\" set apart from the rest of society.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was outlawed by the U.S. government in the 1860s, and Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto in 1890, which declared the Church's intention to submit to these laws and cease the practice of plural marriage. The end of plural marriage was a gradual process, filled with difficulties and uncertainties.\n\nDespite the end of plural marriage, the Church continues to honor and respect the pioneers who practiced it, recognizing the sacrifices they made for their faith. Modern Latter-day Saints believe that plural marriage played a significant role in the growth and development of the Church, and they continue to seek to understand and learn from this challenging aspect of their history.", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The House is expected to re-elect Paul Ryan as Speaker, and the Senate will consider the confirmation of Donald Trump's cabinet picks. Democrats, who hold less power in the new Congress, will try to block some of the GOP's legislative efforts, particularly on healthcare and entitlement programs. The Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, will use filibuster and complex Senate procedures to slow or block elements of Trump's agenda. The Republicans' focus on repealing Obamacare is a top priority, but they have yet to agree on a replacement plan. The tax overhaul and infrastructure bill may provide opportunities for bipartisan cooperation, but these issues are expected to remain on the back burner. The Senate may also consider rolling back environmental regulations and financial regulations, particularly those related to Wall Street. The Senate must also confirm Trump's cabinet picks, and Democrats may try to delay these confirmations by demanding tax returns and other disclosures. The new Congress will also face pressure to address the Russian hacking issue and the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Scalia. The point person for Senate Democrats will be Chuck Schumer, who will join Congress's top leaders in negotiations with Republicans on spending and policies. The new Congress will be predominantly white and male, with 21 women in the Senate, including 16 Democrats and 5 Republicans.

In contrast, higher-skilled male players tend to be more positive towards female gamers, possibly as a strategy to maintain their dominant status and attract potential mates.\n\nThe studies suggest that this behavior can be explained by an evolutionary perspective, as low-status males may use aggression to maintain their social rank and suppress the disturbance caused by the entry of a female competitor.

The study's findings are consistent with previous research that has shown associations between e-cigarette use and subsequent cigarette use among adolescents.\n\nE-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that heat up liquid containing flavors and nicotine, producing a vapor that is inhaled. The liquids used in e-cigarettes can contain varying amounts of nicotine, with some containing no nicotine at all. However, the e-cigarette industry is not regulated, making it difficult to know what ingredients are in any given product.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently took jurisdiction over e-cigarettes, but it will be years before any regulations are put into effect. In the meantime, many products continue to be made in China with little oversight. The FDA has found that some products labeled as containing no nicotine actually contain nicotine, posing a risk to teenagers.\n\nThere is a growing body of research showing that e-cigarettes serve as a gateway to traditional tobacco products. Last month, the USC researchers reported in Pediatrics that adolescents who vape are six times more likely to smoke cigarettes in early adulthood than non-users.

But a new USC study in the journal Pediatrics has found teens who never would have smoked regular cigarettes are experimenting with vaping. Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10540}

Hurricane Harvey: The storm made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane, causing unprecedented flooding and damage. The storm has been described as a \"soggy, record-breaking glimpse of the wet and wild future that global warming could bring\" (Passage 6).\n2. Climate Change and Hurricane Harvey: While scientists are still conducting studies to determine the exact role of climate change in the storm, they agree that warmer air and water contribute to wetter and potentially more intense hurricanes in the future. Warmer air holds more moisture, and warmer water fuels hurricanes (Passage 6).\n3. Political Implications: The response to Hurricane Harvey has raised questions about the role of politics in disaster response. Some news outlets, such as Fox News, have been criticized for using the storm as an opportunity to advance a political agenda, while CNN has been accused of using the storm to \"advance a leftist agenda\" (Passage 7).\n4. Funding and Politics: The response to previous disasters, such as Katrina and Sandy, has been marked by partisan fights over funding for recovery efforts. Conservatives have often demanded offsetting budget cuts to pay for disaster relief, which has been criticized for setting the interests of one geographic area against the national web of communities reliant on ongoing programs (Passage 1).\n5. Climate Change and Politics: The discussion of climate change during a disaster has been described as a \"highly political decision\" (Passage 2). While some argue that it is important to discuss the role of climate change in extreme weather events, others believe it is inappropriate to politicize a disaster. The news passages suggest that the discussion of climate change during a disaster is complex and nuanced, and that it is important to balance the need for accurate information with the need for sensitivity to those affected by the disaster.\n6. Climate Change and Extreme Weather: The news passages also discuss the role of climate change", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

Gevinson also discusses the lack of understanding and respect shown towards young female artists and their work by some male critics.\n\nAnother article on Rookie focuses on the representation of fat women in media, and the impact that negative portrayals can have on real-life women. The author discusses the movie \"Shallow Hal\" and its portrayal of a fat woman, and the harmful messages it sends about body image and self-worth. The article also highlights the importance of authentic and multidimensional representations of fat women in media.\n\nIn another piece, Gevinson reflects on the success of Lorde, a young musician who has gained widespread acclaim for her music.

However, a recent investigation by Politico has revealed that the seven men released were not just \"civilians\" as portrayed by the administration, but were accused of posing threats to national security. Some were part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics and military hardware, including components for surface-to-air and cruise missiles. One was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology. The administration dropped demands for $10 million that a jury said the aerospace engineer illegally received from Iran, and also dropped charges and international arrest warrants for 14 other fugitives. Three of the fugitives allegedly sought to lease Boeing aircraft for an Iranian airline linked to Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Another was accused of procuring thousands of U.S.-made assault rifles and illegally importing them into Iran. Another was accused of smuggling U.S. military antennas to Iran for use in IEDs. The biggest fish was Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who had been working in the U.S. for seven years until his arrest, and was accused of helping Iran's nuclear centrifuge development. The Obama administration pressured federal prosecutors to slow-walk investigations into Iranian procurement efforts and sanctions violations, undermining its own counterproliferation efforts. The investigation was kept largely out of the public eye due to the highly secretive nature of the cases and the negotiations that affected them. The Trump administration and Congress have pledged to crack down on Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and a review of the Iran deal and the Iranians' compliance with it is expected.

Interestingly, all four patients indicated that they were 'happy' with their lives, suggesting that CLIS might not be as miserable as commonly believed. However, the device also revealed some unexpected answers, such as a patient's daughter being told 'no' nine times out of ten when asked if she should marry her boyfriend.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, is a significant breakthrough in communication for CLIS patients, who are typically unable to communicate due to complete paralysis. The researchers plan to develop the device further to allow patients to communicate more proactively, potentially using it to dictate messages or express their thoughts more freely.\n\nAdrian Owen, a neuroscientist at the University of Western Ontario, who is also working on similar technology, praised the study, stating that if the findings can be replicated in a larger group of patients, fNIRS could be a cost-effective and reliable means of communication for CLIS patients. Owen believes that the device could potentially be used to communicate with other brain-injured patients as well.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Niels Birbaumer, expressed his satisfaction with the results, stating that it was one of the most satisfying moments of his career to see the device work. He plans to continue researching the device and its potential applications for CLIS patients.", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system. And it turns out that one of them really didn't want his daughter to marry her boyfriend. The patients all had advanced ALS and were unable to control even their eyes, reports the Guardian. In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 9424}

A new study published in the journal Plos One suggests that the crew was killed instantly by the shockwave created by the submarine's own torpedo explosion. The study was conducted by biomechanist Rachel Lance, who designed a model of the submarine and set off test explosions to simulate the blast. The shockwave transmitted through the submarine's thin hull and caused fatal injuries to the crew, particularly to their lungs. This theory contradicts previous theories that the crew drowned or suffocated, or were killed by gunfire from the enemy ship. The findings of this study provide a possible explanation for the mysterious fate of the H.L. Hunley and its crew.\n\nThe H.L. Hunley was the first combat submarine to sink an enemy ship, the Union blockader USS Housatonic, during the American Civil War. The submarine was raised from the ocean floor in 2000, and since then, researchers have been studying the submarine and its crew to determine the cause of their death. The crew was found seated at their stations, with no signs of physical injuries or attempts to escape. The submarine had no major damage that could be traced to the day it sank.\n\nLance's study suggests that the torpedo explosion created a shockwave that traveled through the submarine's hull and caused fatal injuries to the crew. The shockwave would have traveled faster in the water than in air, and would have caused damage to the crew's lungs, potentially leading to pulmonary hemorrhage. This theory is supported by the fact that the crew's watches were found stopped at the time of the attack, suggesting that they were killed instantly.\n\nThe study provides a possible explanation for the mysterious fate of the H.L. Hunley and its crew, and offers insights into the physical forces that the human body can withstand.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

Lucky then, that \"we already have high-voltage transmission lines that were previously used for the nuclear stations,\" says Semerak. \"And we have many people trained to work at power plants\" (thousands still work at Chernobyl). Plus there's all that inexpensive land. Ukraine's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with Kremlin-backed rebels near the Russian border, not to mention increasing friction with the Putin camp over natural gas bills.

The passage highlights several articles that pertain to crimes against national security, including those related to espionage, insulting religious values, and destruction of historical and cultural assets.\n\n2. The second news passage discusses a report by Amnesty International titled \"Growing Up on Death Row: The Death Penalty and Juvenile Offenders in Iran.\" The report reveals that Iran continues to execute juvenile offenders, in violation of the international ban on the use of the death penalty against individuals under the age of 18 at the time of the crime. The report also criticizes Iran's piecemeal reforms, which have failed to deliver justice to juvenile offenders.\n\n3. The third news passage discusses the rights of children in Iran, focusing on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Iran ratified in 1994.

The bill also proposes a four-year transition period to phase out private insurance and employer-sponsored health plans.\n\nThe bill has garnered support from several Democratic senators, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have signed on as co-sponsors. The bill is expected to face opposition in the Republican-controlled Congress, with Sanders acknowledging that it has no chance of passing in its current form.\n\nThe bill's introduction comes after the failed Republican attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The bill is seen as a response to the rising support for single-payer health care among Americans, with a recent poll showing that 53% of Americans support a national health care plan.\n\nThe bill's financial details are not yet clear, but it is estimated to cost nearly $1.4 trillion annually, to be funded in part by a 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers, and further tax hikes on the wealthy.\n\nWhile the bill has the support of several potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, not all Democrats are on board. Some, such as Chuck Schumer, Sherrod Brown, Dianne Feinstein, and Tim Kaine, have not yet announced their support for the bill.\n\nThe bill's introduction is seen as a significant step towards expanding government-run health care in the United States, with supporters arguing that it is a necessary step towards ensuring health care as a right for all Americans.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test?

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

However, this strategy underestimated the anger and frustration of the Republican electorate, particularly towards the establishment and the Bush family name.\n\nBush's campaign was also ill-prepared for the emergence of Donald Trump, who became the central figure of the Republican primary race. Trump's bombastic style and populist message resonated with voters, while Bush struggled to respond effectively. Trump's attacks on Bush, particularly his labeling of Bush as \"low energy,\" stuck and defined Bush's campaign for much of the race.\n\nBush's campaign also struggled to connect with voters on key issues, particularly immigration. Bush's use of the term \"anchor babies\" in a discussion about birthright citizenship was criticized, and his attempts to clarify his position were not successful.\n\nIn addition, Bush's campaign was plagued by internal disagreements and a lack of flexibility. Advisers debated whether to engage Trump directly, but ultimately decided not to, believing that Trump's candidacy would fade. This decision was criticized as a missed opportunity to challenge Trump's positions.\n\nOverall, Bush's campaign was defined by a lack of adaptability and a failure to connect with voters.

And the ruckus isn't over yet, as the actor is now going after Netflix for a documentary on Guzman, set to start airing Friday, that Penn's spokesman says in an email to the New York Times is a \"profoundly false, foolish, and reckless narrative\" that could put Penn's life in danger. The actor's main bone of contention with The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story: that he thinks the three-episode film hints he assisted the DOJ in helping to capture El Chapo, who was busted right around the time Penn's Rolling Stone article went public. Del Castillo, a Mexican actress, was with Penn when he met with Guzman, and the film is said to take place from her POV. Producer David Broome denies there's anything in the film that says Penn \"is in cahoots\" with the Justice Department and that both he and Netflix tried to see if Penn wanted to take part (Penn reportedly never answered); Netflix backs that up, saying in a statement \"Penn was given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate.\" Broome says when Penn saw an advance copy of the film, he demanded changes. Deadline notes that Penn's lawyers contacted Netflix shortly after and said Penn was afraid Guzman's associates might go after him if the film wasn't altered. A letter from Penn's lawyer to Netflix notes that \"blood will be on [Netflix's] hands if this film causes bodily harm\" to Penn.

The killings were initially linked to a drug-related incident involving the victims and the suspects, Kenneth Brunke, Garry Cordell, and Marietta Carlson. The suspects were arrested and confessed to their involvement in the murders, with Cordell and Carlson implicating Brunke as the mastermind. However, within months, a new confession emerged from Cordell, who claimed that Brunke was not present during the killings and that he and Carlson had committed the murders on their own.\n\nThe prosecutor, Tim Noble, decided to allow Brunke to plead guilty to lesser charges of obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer in exchange for his testimony against Cordell. This decision outraged the victims' families, who believed that crucial evidence was being overlooked. The families were particularly upset because Marietta Carlson, who had initially provided crucial testimony against the suspects, died in custody before she could testify in court.\n\nThe community was shocked by the violence and the handling of the case. The victims were all residents of the Upper Peninsula, with Hutchinson and Nelson having children and grandchildren. The killings were particularly gruesome, with the victims being strangled and their bodies burned. The case brought attention to the growing drug problem in the area and put the young prosecutor, Noble, under scrutiny for his handling of the case.\n\nKenneth Brunke, the suspected mastermind behind the murders, was eventually sentenced to prison for obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer. He will likely serve less than five years in prison under sentencing guidelines. The community is still left with many unanswered questions about the case and the role that Brunke played in the murders.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21.

{"pred": "In recent legal developments, the liability of individuals who send text messages to drivers who are subsequently involved in accidents is being questioned. This issue has been addressed in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey courts, with judges ruling that third-party texters could potentially be held liable if they know or have reason to believe that the recipient is driving and will read the text while doing so.\n\nIn the case of Gallatin v. Gargiulo in Pennsylvania, two men who were texting a driver at the time of a fatal accident are being sued for negligence and wrongful death. The judge ruled that the third-party texters could be held liable if they knew the driver was driving and would view the text while driving, and if they actively encouraged the driver to text while driving.\n\nThis decision follows a 2013 appellate ruling in New Jersey that established the same principle, but noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the third parties knew the driver was driving or actively encouraged her to text while driving.\n\nThe Pennsylvania decision sets a high bar for proving liability, which defense attorney Gary Stewart called a \"can of worms\" because it could potentially make anyone who sends text messages liable if the recipient is driving.\n\nIn the New Jersey case, the court ruled that there was no liability for third-party texters who did not know the driver was driving or actively encourage the driver to text while driving.\n\nThe legal developments could potentially lead to a shift in societal attitudes towards distracted driving, as well as increased accountability for app developers and cell phone companies if their products contribute to accidents. However, it remains to be seen whether these legal changes will lead to increased liability for third-party texters or if manufacturers will be able to avoid legal repercussions.\n\nAdditionally, there have been recent proposals for the use of \"textalyzers\" in New York, which would allow police to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that violates state laws. Privacy advocates have criticized this plan, citing concerns about law enforcement accessing personal information on the phones.\n\nOverall, the legal landscape surrounding distracted driving is evolving, with increased scrutiny being placed on third-party texters and potential liability for app developers and cell phone companies if their products contribute to accidents.", "answers": ["Court rulings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, Consumerist reports. In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...
