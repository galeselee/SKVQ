He provided funding for the building of over 5,300 schools for African-American children, many of which were named after him.\n\nThe documentaries \"Rosenwald\" by Aviva Kempner and the biography by Peter Ascoli bring to light Rosenwald's impact on African-American communities and his dedication to improving the lives of African-Americans. The films feature interviews with prominent African-Americans such as Maya Angelou, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, all of whom attended Rosenwald schools as children.\n\nThe documentaries also highlight Rosenwald's personal and professional connections to Booker T.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

The UK government is facing criticism for missing signs that could have prevented the murder, but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles defends the security services, stating it is impossible to control everyone in a free society. Drummer Rigby, a 25-year-old soldier who served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus, was murdered in a street in Woolwich, south-east London. The suspects were filmed by a passerby, with Adebolajo stating they carried out the attack because British soldiers kill Muslims every day. Armed police arrived on the scene 13 minutes after the first 999 call and shot the two suspects, who were taken to separate London hospitals in stable conditions. A prayer service was held in Drummer Rigby's hometown of Middleton, Greater Manchester, and residents are being urged to fly union jacks in his honor. The former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, Richard Barrett, expressed difficulty in detecting attacks like the one in Woolwich, as the suspects had no overseas connections or broader connections in the UK that could be detected by the security services.\n\nThe second passage reveals footage obtained by the Daily Mirror showing the suspects hatching a plot to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. The suspects lured the police to the scene by dragging the soldier's body into the middle of the road.

However, it is argued that this initiative's focus should shift towards encouraging girls to become leaders, particularly by exposing them to the C-Suite. The current state of women's representation in leadership roles is dismal, with women making up only a small percentage of CEOs, executive officers, and board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo address this issue, companies are encouraged to make several changes. First, they should introduce girls to female role models within the company, as seeing successful women in leadership roles can inspire girls and make leadership more tangible. Second, companies should clearly explain the responsibilities, rewards, and requirements of leadership roles to girls from a young age. This understanding can help them make informed decisions about their careers.\n\nThird, companies should implement proactive efforts to identify and groom female talent throughout the year. This can include encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, as was done at Princeton University, which saw a significant increase in the number of female Rhodes Scholars after implementing such a program.\n\nFinally, companies should provide sponsorship opportunities for women, as sponsors can provide valuable support and opportunities that mentors cannot. This can include advocating for women's careers and providing them with access to valuable networks and resources.\n\nThe importance of these changes is emphasized, as women's underrepresentation in leadership roles is costing companies talent, hurting the country's competitiveness, and undermining ideals of fairness and social equality.

The meeting, which was highly anticipated, was described as a personal encounter between the two leaders, with Trump expressing his eagerness for the discussion. The meeting was significant due to the ongoing tension between the two countries over issues such as Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and the ongoing investigations into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nThe meeting was held in a private setting, with only the two presidents, their foreign ministers, and two translators present. This was seen as a strategic move by Putin, as it would prevent any leaks, similar to what happened during Lavrov's visit to the White House in May. The length of the meeting, which ran over its scheduled time, was emphasized by Russian media as a sign of Russia's importance.\n\nTrump and Putin were filmed shaking hands at the summit, and the US president wrote on Twitter that he looked forward to the meeting and would represent the country well. However, Trump's stance on the Russian interference in the election was ambiguous, as he did not definitively confirm the US intelligence officials' claims.\n\nAhead of the meeting, three US senators expressed concern about reports that the US administration was considering the return of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York, which were seized by the Obama administration in response to alleged Russian election meddling. The senators warned that such a move would embolden Putin and encourage further Russian interference in Western elections.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled shortly after a G20 working session on climate and energy, which Trump was expected to leave early to make the Russia meeting.

{"pred": "In the frigid waters of Antarctica, a unique species of fish known as notothenioids have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in their icy environment. These proteins prevent the freezing of their blood and tissues, but a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has revealed a paradoxical trade-off: the same AFPs that inhibit ice growth also inhibit ice melting, leading to the accumulation of internal ice crystals.\n\nThe research, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, found that AFPs prevent ice from melting at temperatures above the expected melting point, even in laboratory experiments and in the natural environment. This superheated ice persists in the fish's bodies for extended periods, potentially causing long-term damage.\n\nThe study suggests that summer warming, which occurs in the Antarctic, may not be sufficient to rid the fish of internal ice, as the temperatures never exceed the highest temperature at which ice persists inside experimental fishes. This means that notothenioids carry ice crystals around in their veins for most of their lives, a risky proposition that could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams in small capillaries.\n\nThe team also found that the highest concentration of ice crystals resides in the fish's spleens, leading to the hypothesis that the spleen may be trying to filter out the ice crystals to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body. It is possible that the spleen has evolved a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation, but this remains unclear.\n\nThe discovery of this potentially antagonistic effect of AFPs exposes a complex aspect of the evolution of notothenioids. While the AFPs are essential for the fish's survival in their icy environment, they also come with a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. This study provides insights into the evolutionary puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the Antarctic waters and offers a broader understanding of the progression of evolution in all species, highlighting that every good evolutionary innovation may come with some potentially adverse consequences.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

{"pred": "The West Coast of North America is experiencing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that supports a diverse marine ecosystem. This decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, and overfishing. The decline in sardine population is causing concern for various species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that rely on sardines as a major food source.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. The decline in sardine population is also affecting the livelihood of commercial fishermen, with many reporting a significant decrease in catches.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is particularly concerning because sardines are a staple of the commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast. If the sardine population does not recover soon, experts warn that the West Coast's marine ecosystem could suffer for years, and fishermen could face long-term consequences.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is also causing concern for marine predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and other seabirds that rely on sardines for food. In 2013, 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego, with scientists attributing the malnourishment to a scarcity of prey, particularly sardines.\n\nThe sardine fishery has a history of volatility, with populations fluctuating widely. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. Geological records indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons.\n\nFor further information", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The film, which premieres this week, has been criticized for its portrayal of racial stereotypes and homophobic humor. During a Q&A session, audience members voiced concerns about the film's handling of racial stereotypes and its depiction of homosexuality. Critics have particularly taken issue with Ferrell's character's fear of being raped in prison, which includes a scene involving a gay man.\n\nThe film's creators, including director Ethan Cohen and stars Ferrell and Hart, have defended the movie as a satire, not a representation of stereotypes. Ferrell stated that the comedy provokes and prods, showing a mirror to existing attitudes and misconceptions. Hart added that the film explores the journey of two characters who, upon peeling back layers, realize their prejudices.\n\nThe comedy was written by Cohen, who has a history of writing for films like \"Idiocracy\" and \"Tropic Thunder.\" The humor, similar to \"Tropic Thunder,\" is intended to comment on contemporary issues of inequality and race within a broad, often crude comedy context. However, some critics argue that the film's humor is not offensive enough and is disappointing.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexa Internet, known for donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, continues its data donation.

This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions such as colds, flu, bronchitis, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nThe study found that 13% of all outpatient visits result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions being for acute respiratory conditions.

The study also highlighted that the majority of antibiotic use in the U.S. occurs in outpatient settings, making it crucial to address the issue of overuse in these settings.\n\nThe CDC and Pew have outlined strategies to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, including:\n1.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity use from the grid during peak demand by 65%, while south-facing panels reduced it by 54%.\n\nThe study's findings could significantly impact the residential solar market, as homeowners with west-facing roofs, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar due to their roof orientation, may now find their west-facing roofs to be a better location for solar panels. This could encourage more homeowners to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nThe study's results align with a 2011 California Public Utility Commission study, which also found that west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load compared to south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields.

Two of the arrested men are brothers, and at least one of them is reported to speak fluent Japanese.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread outrage in India, where sexual violence against women has been a growing concern. The case has been highlighted in the media, with the BBC and other news outlets reporting on the incident. The police are still searching for other members of the alleged gang, some of whom are reported to be proficient in Japanese.\n\nThe incident has brought renewed attention to the issue of sexual violence against foreign tourists in India. The case is reminiscent of other incidents involving foreign women, such as a Swiss cyclist who was assaulted in central India in 2013 and a Danish tourist who was attacked in Delhi in 2014. The incidents have prompted a domestic and international outcry, leading to tougher anti-rape laws in India. However, the effectiveness of these laws in deterring such crimes remains questionable.\n\nThe incident in Bodh Gaya is particularly concerning as it occurred at a holy site and a major tourist destination. The incident may have a negative impact on tourism in the area, which is a significant source of income for the local economy.

He and other accomplices then allegedly held her in a village near Bodh Gaya, a popular destination because of its Buddhist pilgrimage center, and repeatedly raped her, reports the Guardian. Details of the case are still coming together, and reports differ substantially. Most accounts say she eventually escaped and reached authorities in Varanasi, for example, while the Times of India says her captors put her on a bus. Some reports say she was held 12 days, some three weeks, and others (including the BBC) for more than a month. All seem to agree, though, that gangs are preying on female Japanese tourists.

{"pred": "In the news, there are several passages discussing various topics related to international relations, cybersecurity, and diplomacy.\n\n1. President Barack Obama has ordered the creation of a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks, as outlined in a top-secret presidential directive, known as Presidential Policy Directive 20. The directive, signed in October 2012, details the use of Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO) and the potential consequences of such actions. The aim is to establish a framework for the government to make decisions on cyber actions, with a focus on effectiveness and risk assessment. The directive also addresses the possibility of cyber actions inside the US, with the president's approval required in certain cases.\n\n2. The Obama administration has been refining its use of offensive cyber operations to counter electronic assaults against the US. Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, stated that the directive signed by President Obama calls for government cyber tools to be integrated with other national security tools. This comes as President Obama is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with cybersecurity being one of the main topics of discussion.\n\n3. The Guardian's report on the US's cyber targets list coincides with the meeting between Obama and Xi, with allegations of Chinese hacking against the US being a contentious issue. Both leaders have agreed to have \"more extensive discussions\" on cybersecurity during their private dinner.\n\n4. The Obama-Xi meeting at Sunnylands estate in California is intended to forge a personal rapport and reverse a downward spiral in relations between the two countries. Both leaders have much at stake, with many economic and security concerns on the table, including cyberespionage, North Korea's nuclear program, Beijing's maritime disputes in Asia, and Chinese market reforms.\n\n5. The meeting is an opportunity for President Obama to get to know President Xi, while addressing the US's long-standing concerns about Chinese cyberespionage and other issues. The news conference was dominated by cybersecurity, with both leaders acknowledging the need for rules and common approaches to cybersecurity.\n\n6. The Sunnylands estate, where the meeting is taking place, was built by Leonore and Walter Annenberg and was intended to be a place for presidents to relax and parley with world leaders.", "answers": ["Cyber-spying, trade, North Korea, US military maneuvers—there's no shortage of big issues for President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping to tackle tonight and tomorrow during their informal summit in Southern California. But the biggest emphasis is on establishing \"personal chemistry,\" reports the Wall Street Journal. The leaders will have six hours of talks, a private dinner, and walks around the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage to try to achieve it. As the summit opened this evening, Obama said he hoped it would establish a \"new model of cooperation\" between the nations, and Xi used the phrase \"a new model of major country relations,\" reports Politico. China's alleged cyber-spying is likely at the top of the US agenda, and the Guardian reinforced the point earlier today with a story saying that Obama ordered up a list of potential overseas cyber-targets last year. It doesn't include specifics, but any such list would likely have plenty of Chinese targets. (The AP doesn't think the story is bombshell material—it notes that the White House released a declassified version of the president's directive in January.) As for the summit, the New York Times has the unusual detail that while Obama will be sleeping on site at the estate in Rancho Mirage, Xi and his officials will bunk at a nearby hotel, apparently worried about their rooms being bugged."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5411}

Armstrong, 47, had been estranged from his wife, Taylor Armstrong, and was staying with a friend at the time of his death. The couple's relationship had been portrayed as tumultuous on the show, with Taylor accusing Russell of physical abuse during their marriage.\n\nIn the days leading up to his death, Russell reportedly expressed regret about his participation in the show, telling a friend that it had ruined his life. He also expressed concern about a tell-all book that was set to reveal secrets about his sexuality, including bisexual tendencies and preferences for S&M.\n\nArmstrong's attorney, Ronald Richards, denied the existence of the book and any allegations of adultery. Armstrong had a history of violence, including allegations of abuse by Taylor and restraining orders filed against him by his ex-wife and an ex-girlfriend.\n\nArmstrong leaves behind a daughter from his marriage to Taylor and two sons from previous relationships. The new season of 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' was set to premiere on September 5, but it is unclear how Bravo will handle the tragedy.\n\nThe news of Armstrong's death has sparked an outpouring of sympathy and condolences from fans and fellow cast members. Bravo's executive vice president of original programming, Andy Cohen, tweeted his condolences, and Taylor Armstrong issued a statement requesting privacy at this difficult time.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Armstrong's death raise questions about the impact of reality TV on the lives of its participants, particularly when it comes to portraying personal and sensitive issues on national television. Some have suggested that the pressure to maintain a certain image and the exposure to public scrutiny can take a toll on mental health and relationships.\n\nRabbi Schmuley Boteach, who once counseled Michael Jackson, has said that the key to surviving celebrity culture is to have a life outside of the spotlight and to maintain spiritual values.

The Los Angeles Times, Christian Science Monitor, and two separate Daily Beast stories all delve into that question, noting that Armstrong's marriage troubles were splashed all over television during the first season of the franchise's Beverly Hills version. Sources say the show pressured the Armstrongs to live beyond their means—they were actually millions in debt and being sued by investors—and also pressured them to ramp up the drama in their relationship. Radar reports that Armstrong told a friend, days before his death, that reality TV had ruined his \"entire life.\" But Armstrong's ex-wife blames estranged wife Taylor, from whom Armstrong was getting divorced. \"She's bad news and she drove him into this,\" the ex tells Radar. \"I don't think it was the show. I think she drove him into financial stress and it just ruined him.\" Radar offers up another possible reason: A tell-all was about to be published, and would reveal that he was bisexual and may have had affairs with men.

{"pred": "A new study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association has challenged the long-standing practice of removing cancerous lymph nodes from the armpit of breast cancer patients. The study, which involved 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer, found that for women who meet certain criteria (approximately 20% of patients, or 40,000 women annually in the U.S.), the removal of cancerous lymph nodes does not improve survival rates, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or prevent the disease from spreading. The study's findings are significant because lymph node removal has been a standard practice for over a century, with the belief that it prevents cancer from spreading.\n\nThe study's results are particularly relevant for women with early-stage breast cancer (clinical stage T1 or T2) whose armpit nodes were biopsied but not enlarged or felt during an exam, and whose cancer had not spread elsewhere. These women underwent lumpectomy, radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. The study included 115 medical centers and followed patients for a median of 6.3 years.\n\nThe study found that removing additional lymph nodes did not improve survival rates or reduce the recurrence of breast cancer. In fact, 27% of the women who had additional nodes removed had cancer in those nodes. However, the study's results were not affected by the missing follow-up information of 166 women.\n\nThe study's findings are part of a broader trend moving away from radical surgery for breast cancer. This trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer, with a shift from the belief that surgery can \"get it all\" to a focus on cutting out obvious tumors and using radiation and chemotherapy to eliminate microscopic disease.\n\nThe study's results are expected to change medical practice for many patients, but experts note that change may take time due to the deeply ingrained belief in removing lymph nodes. Some medical centers, such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, have already changed their practice based on the new information.\n\nIt is important to note that the study's findings do not apply to all patients.
