{"pred": "Scott Sears, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, has achieved the record of becoming the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo, completing a 702-mile trek in 38 days through harsh Antarctic conditions. He pulled a sled carrying supplies and navigated through 150mph winds, temperatures of -50°C, and crevasse-filled terrain. His journey began at Hercules Inlet, where the ground is riddled with crevasses, and he faced the challenge of traveling alone, without the safety of being roped to a teammate.\n\nSears, who is the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray, experienced a particularly challenging day just 38km (24 miles) from his destination on Christmas Eve. He hit a wall midway through the day, but managed to push through with some rest and motivation from his iPod. He even hung his socks as makeshift stockings on Christmas Eve, hoping Santa wouldn't miss him.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Sears reached the South Pole, arriving a week earlier than expected. He wrote that he was \"absolutely chuffed to pieces\" and looked forward to the experience sinking in. He is currently waiting for a plane to take him back to Union Glacier, expressing that the experience has been overwhelming due to his isolation for nearly six weeks.\n\nSears's expedition has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust, an organization that helps rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. His mother-in-law, Judy Murray, congratulated him on Twitter. The Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears's feat will make it into the record books.", "answers": ["While many people were unwrapping gifts on Christmas Day, the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray was wrapping up a 700-mile, 38-day journey through brutally cold temps and blistering winds—and, he hopes, setting a world record. Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph. (Prince Harry drank champagne out of a prosthetic leg when he arrived at the South Pole.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 951}
