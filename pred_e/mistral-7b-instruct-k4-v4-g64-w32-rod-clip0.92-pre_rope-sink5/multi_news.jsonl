This understanding can help them make better choices about their own careers and overcome the fear of leadership that many girls express.\n\nThe articles also mention the success of Princeton University's proactive efforts to encourage female students to apply for academic prizes and hold visible leadership roles, which resulted in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.

These women either lacked a uterus at birth or lost it due to cancer. The women were able to produce eggs through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the embryos were transferred into their newly transplanted wombs. Dr. Brannstrom anticipates that three to four of the women may successfully give birth, which would be a world first in this field.\n\nPrevious attempts at womb transplants have taken place in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but no recipients have yet given birth. A pregnancy was achieved in Turkey, but it ended after two months. The Swedish team's technique is unique as they are using wombs donated by living relatives or friends of the recipients, while elsewhere, wombs from deceased donors have been used.\n\nThe procedure is controversial due to the risks involved for the donor and ethical questions regarding non-life-saving procedures. The recipients will need to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to prevent rejection of the transplanted womb and will be closely monitored due to concerns about how the physiological changes in the uterus may affect the mother and the growing baby. The transplanted wombs will be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to help women who are unable to conceive due to the loss of their uterus. However, there are still many uncertainties and questions about the long-term effects of the transplanted womb on both the mother and the baby.

In a move to adapt to the digital age and the widespread availability of explicit content online, the magazine will no longer publish fully nude images of women. This decision was made during a meeting with Playboy's founder, Hugh Hefner, who is still listed as editor-in-chief, and was confirmed by Scott Flanders, the company's chief executive.\n\nThe magazine's executives acknowledge that Playboy has been overtaken by the changes it helped to initiate. They argue that the internet has made nudity outdated and that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. The print edition of Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses, but not in a fully nude format.\n\nThis decision marks a significant shift for Playboy, which was founded in 1953 and gained notoriety for its nudity and high-profile interviews. The magazine's website has already removed nudity, a move that has boosted its popularity, with web traffic quadrupling.\n\nPlayboy's logo, featuring a rabbit head wearing a bow tie, is one of the most recognizable in the world. The company makes most of its money from licensing its brand for products such as toiletries, drinks, and jewelry. About 40% of merchandising income is generated in China, where the magazine itself is not available.\n\nThe magazine has a circulation of around 800,000, significantly lower than its pre-Internet peak. By removing nude photos, Playboy hopes to appeal to a broader and younger audience both in print and online. However, this move may alienate the magazine's long-time subscriber base, as some critics argue that the magazine is losing its identity and is no longer serving its original purpose.\n\nPlayboy's interviews with notable figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jimmy Carter, Miles Davis, Vladimir Nabokov, John Lennon, and Yoko Ono have made it culturally and politically significant.

These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's blood, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins.\n\nThe researchers found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This mechanism, while essential for the fish's survival in freezing temperatures, may have unintended consequences. The ice crystals can persist inside the fish's body even during summer warming episodes, potentially causing damage to the fish's capillaries and organs, such as the spleen.\n\nThe researchers studied the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions and discovered the anti-melting properties of AFPs after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. They also found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species' icy veins, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives.\n\nThe study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides a better understanding of the progression of all species, as it shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with it.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fish species, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's blood, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins.\n\nThe researchers found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This mechanism, while essential for the fish's survival in freezing temperatures, may have unintended consequences. The ice crystals can persist inside the fish's body even during summer warming episodes, potentially causing damage to the fish's capillaries and organs, such as the spleen.\n\nThe researchers studied the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions and discovered the anti-melting properties of AFPs after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. They also found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species' icy veins, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives.\n\nThe study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides a better understanding of the progression of all species, as it shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with it.

The find, a stone tool made from orange agate, was discovered at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley, and is believed to be older than any known site of human occupation in the region. The tool was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens, which has been dated to 15,800 years ago. If the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and older than the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America.\n\nThe discovery was made by archaeologists from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, who have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011. Their discoveries include stone projectile points, tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel, and the stone tool. A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo.\n\nThe discovery has been met with skepticism from some in the scientific community, who are waiting for the findings to be published in a scientific journal and for further evidence to be uncovered. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses, and bison roamed the area.

The find, a stone tool made from orange agate, was discovered at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley, and is believed to be older than any known site of human occupation in the region. The tool was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens, which has been dated to 15,800 years ago. If the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and older than the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America.\n\nThe discovery was made by archaeologists from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, who have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011. Their discoveries include stone projectile points, tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel, and the stone tool. A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo.\n\nThe discovery has been met with skepticism from some in the scientific community, who are waiting for the findings to be published in a scientific journal and for further evidence to be uncovered. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses, and bison roamed the area. The find has the potential to significantly alter our understanding of the early human history of North America.\n\nThe University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers, and volunteers invaluable field experience as they continue to excavate the site and search for further evidence to support the claim that the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter is home to one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States.", "answers": ["A small stone tool unearthed in eastern Oregon appears to be so ancient that the history of humans in the area may have to be rewritten, archaeologists say.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has been in decline for several years, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but it is believed to be a combination of natural fluctuations in the ocean environment and overfishing.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is causing concern as it could lead to a food shortage for various marine predators, potentially leading to their starvation. The decline has already been linked to the malnourishment of sea lion pups along the West Coast.\n\nThe PFMC is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington. They are urged to take immediate action to protect the sardine population and the overall health of the West Coast ecosystem. This includes setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.\n\nFor further information, readers are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish, and the PFMC can be contacted at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov. The sardine fishing industry is also struggling due to the decline, with fishermen returning to port without a catch after spending significant amounts of time and resources.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, but the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. If the sardine population does not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years. The PFMC's actions are crucial in ensuring the health of the West Coast ecosystem and the sustainability of the fishing industry.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has been in decline for several years, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but it is believed to be a combination of natural fluctuations in the ocean environment and overfishing.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is causing concern as it could lead to a food shortage for various marine predators, potentially leading to their starvation. The decline has already been linked to the malnourishment of sea lion pups along the West Coast.\n\nThe PFMC is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington. They are urged to take immediate action to protect the sardine population and the overall health of the West Coast ecosystem. This includes setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.\n\nFor further information, readers are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish, and the PFMC can be contacted at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov. The sardine fishing industry is also struggling due to the decline, with fishermen returning to port without a catch after spending significant amounts of time and resources.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, but the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. If the sardine population does not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years. The PFMC's actions are crucial in ensuring the health of the West Coast ecosystem and the sustainability of the fishing industry.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings, such as doctors' offices and emergency rooms, are unnecessary. This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011, which represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in the United States. The studies found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the U.S. result in an antibiotic prescription, with more than 44% of these prescriptions written for patients with acute respiratory conditions. Half of these prescriptions are deemed unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs.

To achieve this, health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole are encouraged to take action, such as evaluating prescribing habits, implementing stewardship activities, providing expertise and resources, assisting in data collection and analysis, and tracking antibiotic prescribing at the national level.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts are also preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing, which", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times.

Others have shared stories of memorable moments, such as Miguel Cabrera's impressive play, where he hit a single on an attempted intentional walk.\n\nHowever, some argue that the rule change will have minimal impact on the pace of play, as intentional walks only took an estimated 35 seconds per game in 2016. Critics also suggest that the rule change is not worth the effort, given its insignificant impact on game duration.\n\nIn response to the rule change, some have proposed more entertaining alternatives, such as having the center fielder throw the intentional walk or requiring the manager to perform a dance as the signal for an intentional walk. These suggestions aim to maintain the theatrics associated with the intentional walk while potentially speeding up the game.\n\nIn the digital sphere, users continue to engage with location-based Tweets, while baseball fans and players grapple with the loss of a tradition, albeit one that may not have had a significant impact on gameplay.", "answers": ["Those who complain baseball is too slow may be heartened to hear a quicker pace is on its way.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings, such as doctors' offices and emergency rooms, are unnecessary. This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011, which represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in the United States. The studies found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the U.S. result in an antibiotic prescription, with more than 44% of these prescriptions written for patients with acute respiratory conditions. Half of these prescriptions are deemed unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs. The CDC has warned about the rise of these superbugs, which pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. In response, the White House announced an aggressive plan in 2014 to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, setting a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020.\n\nBased on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15%, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. To achieve this, health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole are encouraged to take action, such as evaluating prescribing habits, implementing stewardship activities, providing expertise and resources, assisting in data collection and analysis, and tracking antibiotic prescribing at the national level.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts are also preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing, which", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}
{"pred": "The unemployment insurance system in the United States is facing a crisis due to the surge in unemployment and, in some cases, poor planning. As of last year, a record 20 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits, and thirty states have depleted their funds, forcing them to borrow from the federal government, raise taxes on employers, or reduce benefits. The situation is worsening in many other states.\n\nTo provide insights into the health of each state's unemployment insurance trust fund and its impact on citizens, a news application has been developed. This application offers near real-time data on state revenues and benefits paid out, allowing users to click on a state for the latest information, historical data, and details on tax increases and benefit cuts. However, it is important to note that this news application is no longer being updated as of February 3, 2011, but the historical data remains accurate.\n\nIn Virginia, the unemployment insurance trust fund has been drained, leading to increased taxes on employers and reduced benefits for seniors. Business owners, like Don Miller, are concerned about the added expense of hiring due to the tax increase. Meanwhile, seniors like James Hay are facing reduced benefits, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe situation is not unique to Virginia. Many states are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have implemented politically difficult tax increases or benefit cuts. Some states, such as Virginia, let their trust funds dwindle below the recommended 18 months of reserves, making it necessary to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors.\n\nEconomist Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution argues that increasing taxes on employers during a recession is counterproductive, as it may contribute to joblessness rather than stimulating the economy. On the other hand, Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, contends that cutting unemployment benefits undermines the fundamental goals of the program, which are to boost the economy and keep people out of poverty during an economic downturn.\n\nIn conclusion, the unemployment insurance system in the United States is in crisis due to high unemployment and, in some cases, poor planning.

{"pred": "The unemployment insurance system in the United States is facing a crisis due to the surge in unemployment and, in some cases, poor planning. As of last year, a record 20 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits, and thirty states have depleted their funds, forcing them to borrow from the federal government, raise taxes on employers, or reduce benefits. The situation is worsening in many other states.\n\nTo provide insights into the health of each state's unemployment insurance trust fund and its impact on citizens, a news application has been developed. This application offers near real-time data on state revenues and benefits paid out, allowing users to click on a state for the latest information, historical data, and details on tax increases and benefit cuts. However, it is important to note that this news application is no longer being updated as of February 3, 2011, but the historical data remains accurate.\n\nIn Virginia, the unemployment insurance trust fund has been drained, leading to increased taxes on employers and reduced benefits for seniors. Business owners, like Don Miller, are concerned about the added expense of hiring due to the tax increase. Meanwhile, seniors like James Hay are facing reduced benefits, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe situation is not unique to Virginia. Many states are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have implemented politically difficult tax increases or benefit cuts. Some states, such as Virginia, let their trust funds dwindle below the recommended 18 months of reserves, making it necessary to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors.\n\nEconomist Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution argues that increasing taxes on employers during a recession is counterproductive, as it may contribute to joblessness rather than stimulating the economy. On the other hand, Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, contends that cutting unemployment benefits undermines the fundamental goals of the program, which are to boost the economy and keep people out of poverty during an economic downturn.\n\nIn conclusion, the unemployment insurance system in the United States is in crisis due to high unemployment and, in some cases, poor planning. Thirty states have already depleted their funds, and many others are rapidly approaching that point.

Six papers released by the journal Science detail the rover's discoveries, providing insights into Mars' early epochs, approximately three to four billion years ago. The findings suggest that early Mars was in many ways similar to Earth, potentially supporting microbial life.\n\nOne of the key discoveries is the evidence of an ancient Martian lake, which could have supported life as we know it for long periods, possibly millions of years. This lake, located in Gale Crater, was likely fed by streams originating from mountains and covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide crater. The lake's sedimentary rocks, known as mudstones, contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of the ancient freshwater lake.\n\nThe lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. These microbes are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on Earth.\n\nThe lake is estimated to have existed for at least tens of thousands of years, and possibly much longer. The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis.\n\nCuriosity's mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover's analysis of the mudstones has confirmed and extended its landmark discovery, providing a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago.\n\nWhile Curiosity has not been designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars, the discovery of a potentially habitable environment for chemolithoautotrophs opens up the possibility that life may have existed on Mars in the past. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of the ancient lake, Curiosity has also made progress in its search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds. While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far, their origin remains unclear due to the presence of a chlorine-based compound and an organic solvent that may be contaminating the samples.", "answers": ["The Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of an ancient freshwater lake on Mars that was brimming with the key chemicals necessary to support microbial life, and its findings suggest that it could have held that life more recently than we thought—and possibly for millions of years before that. \"Quite honestly it just looks very Earth-like,\" the Curiosity's lead scientist said, according to Space.com.

His teeth, both front and back, were heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and using them as tools. He also suffered from gum disease and cavities, which may have been caused by his diet rich in whole-grain bread and gruel. The study suggests that the increase in starch consumption during the late Stone Age could explain the rising frequency of cavities at that time.\n\nSecondly, an international team has sequenced Ötzi's entire genome, providing new insights into his ancestry and health conditions. The genome sequencing confirms Ötzi's severe arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, despite him having no known risk factors such as being overweight, inactive, or a smoker. This suggests that our understanding of preventing arteriosclerosis may be limited.\n\nThe genome sequencing also reveals that Ötzi belonged to the rare G2A4 haplogroup, which originated from a population that migrated from the Near East to Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era. His closest genetic matches are found among small populations in Sardinia, Corsica, Georgia, and remote areas of Russia. This does not mean Ötzi was from these regions, but rather that these populations share genetic similarities with the original hunter-gatherers who migrated into Europe.\n\nThe genome analysis also reveals that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and was lactose intolerant, which was common among Neolithic Europeans. Interestingly, Ötzi was the first known carrier of Lyme disease, as the sequencing yielded genes from the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium.

{"pred": "NASA's Curiosity rover, currently on Mars, has delivered significant findings from its exploration of the red planet. Six papers released by the journal Science detail the rover's discoveries, providing insights into Mars' early epochs, approximately three to four billion years ago. The findings suggest that early Mars was in many ways similar to Earth, potentially supporting microbial life.\n\nOne of the key discoveries is the evidence of an ancient Martian lake, which could have supported life as we know it for long periods, possibly millions of years. This lake, located in Gale Crater, was likely fed by streams originating from mountains and covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide crater. The lake's sedimentary rocks, known as mudstones, contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of the ancient freshwater lake.\n\nThe lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. These microbes are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on Earth.\n\nThe lake is estimated to have existed for at least tens of thousands of years, and possibly much longer. The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis.\n\nCuriosity's mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover's analysis of the mudstones has confirmed and extended its landmark discovery, providing a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago.\n\nWhile Curiosity has not been designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars, the discovery of a potentially habitable environment for chemolithoautotrophs opens up the possibility that life may have existed on Mars in the past. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of the ancient lake, Curiosity has also made progress in its search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds. While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far, their origin remains unclear due to the presence of a chlorine-based compound and an organic solvent that may be contaminating the samples.", "answers": ["The Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of an ancient freshwater lake on Mars that was brimming with the key chemicals necessary to support microbial life, and its findings suggest that it could have held that life more recently than we thought—and possibly for millions of years before that. \"Quite honestly it just looks very Earth-like,\" the Curiosity's lead scientist said, according to Space.com.

His teeth, both front and back, were heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and using them as tools. He also suffered from gum disease and cavities, which may have been caused by his diet rich in whole-grain bread and gruel. The study suggests that the increase in starch consumption during the late Stone Age could explain the rising frequency of cavities at that time.\n\nSecondly, an international team has sequenced Ötzi's entire genome, providing new insights into his ancestry and health conditions. The genome sequencing confirms Ötzi's severe arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, despite him having no known risk factors such as being overweight, inactive, or a smoker. This suggests that our understanding of preventing arteriosclerosis may be limited.\n\nThe genome sequencing also reveals that Ötzi belonged to the rare G2A4 haplogroup, which originated from a population that migrated from the Near East to Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era. His closest genetic matches are found among small populations in Sardinia, Corsica, Georgia, and remote areas of Russia. This does not mean Ötzi was from these regions, but rather that these populations share genetic similarities with the original hunter-gatherers who migrated into Europe.\n\nThe genome analysis also reveals that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and was lactose intolerant, which was common among Neolithic Europeans. Interestingly, Ötzi was the first known carrier of Lyme disease, as the sequencing yielded genes from the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium.

The studies, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University, found that higher levels of potato consumption before pregnancy were associated with a greater risk of developing gestational diabetes. The studies tracked the diets of over 15,000 women from 1991 to 2001 and found that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk of developing gestational diabetes by 9-12%. The studies also found that potatoes have a high glycemic index, which can elevate blood sugar levels. To reduce the risk, it is recommended to swap potatoes with green leafy vegetables and whole grains, which have less starch, less carbohydrate, but are high in fiber and vitamins. Alternatives to potatoes on the dinner plate include mashed cauliflower and healthier versions of potato chips, such as quinoa chips and lentil chips. Women should aim for no more than one serving of potatoes per week, as they contain healthful nutrients but the risk increases with higher consumption.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

The studies, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University, found that higher levels of potato consumption before pregnancy were associated with a greater risk of developing gestational diabetes. The studies tracked the diets of over 15,000 women from 1991 to 2001 and found that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk of developing gestational diabetes by 9-12%. The studies also found that potatoes have a high glycemic index, which can elevate blood sugar levels. To reduce the risk, it is recommended to swap potatoes with green leafy vegetables and whole grains, which have less starch, less carbohydrate, but are high in fiber and vitamins. Alternatives to potatoes on the dinner plate include mashed cauliflower and healthier versions of potato chips, such as quinoa chips and lentil chips.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during the Mormon pioneers' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. The photos were unveiled at a news conference in Salt Lake City as part of the church's push to be more transparent and fill a void on the Internet for accurate information about the religion.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a religious text considered sacred by Mormons, and its translation is a significant part of the religion's history. According to the church, Joseph Smith translated the book from gold plates using the stone and other tools, with the help of several scribes. The translation process is not fully understood, but the church has acknowledged that it was done \"by the gift and power of God.\"\n\nThe Book of Mormon was first published in 1830 and has since been translated into many languages. The translation process is said to have taken place over a short period of time, with Joseph Smith dictating the text from another language. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, which still survives, includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript, and some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English.\n\nThe stone that was recently photographed is believed to have been used in conjunction with the Urim and Thummim, a pair of clear stones bound together with a metal rim that was found with the gold plates. The Urim and Thummim were said to have been used for interpreting languages. Another instrument used in the translation process was a seer stone, a small oval stone that Joseph Smith discovered before he retrieved the gold plates.\n\nThe translation of the Book of Mormon is considered a miraculous event by Mormons, and the church has acknowledged the contribution of scholars to understanding the historical content of the text.

The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate,\" says study co-author Isabella Velicogna of the University of California Irvine, per the AP. \"Things are happening.

The Gold Butte National Monument, located near Las Vegas, Nevada, protects a scenic and ecologically fragile area that includes rock art, artifacts, rare fossils, and recently discovered dinosaur tracks.\n\nThe designations were met with opposition from state Republican leaders and rural residents who argue that it adds another layer of unnecessary federal control and restricts new energy development.

The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during the Mormon pioneers' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. The photos were unveiled at a news conference in Salt Lake City as part of the church's push to be more transparent and fill a void on the Internet for accurate information about the religion.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a religious text considered sacred by Mormons, and its translation is a significant part of the religion's history.

Additionally, Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience, one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, decided to cancel his climb and return home due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening climbers, abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face, and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Additionally, Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience, one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, decided to cancel his climb and return home due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, a massive serac threatening climbers, abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face, and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The show initially followed a format similar to conventional newscasts, but with a pop-culture twist.\n   - In 1998, Kilborn left to host a late-night show on CBS, and Jon Stewart was chosen to replace him. Stewart brought a new direction to the show, focusing on political satire and deconstructing the news.\n   - Stewart faced resistance from some of the original writers who were accustomed to the show's previous format. However, he was able to bring in new writers, such as Ben Karlin and David Javerbaum, who shared his vision.\n   - Key additions to the on-air talent included Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and Mo Rocca, who helped establish The Daily Show's unique style of political satire.\n   - The show gained popularity and critical acclaim, particularly during the 2000 presidential election, when it began to focus on deconstructing the political process rather than just making jokes.\n\n2.

The researchers used static facial photographs of 80 men and 80 women and found that people were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men, but not women, based on their facial photographs. The study found that certain facial traits, such as a longer face with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin, were associated with the perception of high intelligence in men.

If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto was demoted to a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006, in part due to the work of Mike Brown, one of the researchers involved in the discovery of Planet Nine. Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" has been working on this discovery for his daughter, who was upset about Pluto's demotion.\n\nThe researchers have not yet observed Planet Nine directly, but they have used mathematical equations and computer models to infer its existence. They suggest that the planet might have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which is on average 20 times farther away than Neptune. If it exists, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, but its extreme distance would make it difficult to observe.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would rewrite the textbooks, as it would be the first planet discovered in the modern era, not counting Pluto.

The spacecraft, which has been traveling for nine and a half years, will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto, providing the first close-up view of the dwarf planet and its five known moons.\n\nPluto, discovered in 1930, is the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system extending beyond Neptune. It was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to its size and orbit. The New Horizons mission aims to shed light on the origins of the solar system and the Kuiper Belt, which is believed to contain trillions of comets and several hundred thousand objects larger than 60 miles across.\n\nThe spacecraft has already delivered data that is a \"gift for the ages,\" according to Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator. The data reveals that Pluto is bigger than previously thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles. This new measurement settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, as Pluto surpasses Eris, another Kuiper Belt inhabitant.\n\nThe new size of Pluto also means that its interior contains more ice than previously estimated, which has implications for the process that formed the binary planet system and the chemistry of the disk of dust, gas, and ice that encircled the sun and provided the building blocks for the planets and their moons.\n\nNew Horizons has also revealed a tremendous diversity between the two planets in the system and their moons, with complex and nuanced surfaces that suggest a history beyond scientists' wildest dreams. The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and alien beauty, with features similar to those on Neptune's moon Triton, which is also thought to be a Kuiper Belt object.\n\nThe spacecraft will take hundreds of observations of Pluto and its moons during the flyby, with the first of the highest-resolution images to be released on Wednesday afternoon. The rest of the data will trickle in over the next 16", "answers": ["This is one of the biggest days in the exploration of our solar system since Voyager 2 approached Neptune in 1989—and there may not be a day like it again. According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

The researchers have not observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the motion of smaller objects in the outer solar system. If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto was demoted to a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006, in part due to the work of Mike Brown, one of the researchers involved in the discovery of Planet Nine. Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" has been working on this discovery for his daughter, who was upset about Pluto's demotion.\n\nThe researchers have not yet observed Planet Nine directly, but they have used mathematical equations and computer models to infer its existence. They suggest that the planet might have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which is on average 20 times farther away than Neptune. If it exists, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, but its extreme distance would make it difficult to observe.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would rewrite the textbooks, as it would be the first planet discovered in the modern era, not counting Pluto.

Damascus, the stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad, is experiencing a significant transformation due to the war. The city, once known for its vibrant nightlife and all-night parties, is now a city under siege. Traffic is frequently disrupted due to checkpoints, and people are wary of venturing out after dark due to kidnappings and increased violence. Basic necessities such as gasoline and food are becoming scarce, and there are concerns about shortages during the winter.\n\n2.

This success is attributed to investments in parks, cruise lines, and Asia, as well as the success of the film studio. The transformation of California Adventure into a Pixar-themed park, with the addition of Cars Land, has been a major contributor to the park's increased popularity. The success of films like The Avengers, which grossed $1.5 billion at the global box office, allows Disney to generate additional revenue through toy sales, TV spin-offs, and merchandise. However, the focus on big-budget films has made it difficult for smaller films to be produced, as studios are prioritizing films with the potential for spin-offs and merchandise.\n\nMeanwhile, filmmakers like John Waters and David Lynch are struggling to secure funding for their films due to the shift towards blockbuster movies. The budgets for mid-budget films have become smaller, making it difficult for filmmakers to make a living. As a result, many filmmakers are turning to television for more creative freedom and a larger audience. The success of shows like True Detective and Transparent has attracted directors like Cary Fukunaga, Jill Soloway, and David Fincher to television. However, the budgets for television shows are often similar to those of low-budget films, and the storytelling is different from that of a feature film.\n\nThe current filmmaking model is facing challenges, with attendance down and the foreign sales model potentially collapsing. Some experts predict that there will be an implosion of mega-budget movies in the near future, which could change the paradigm of the industry. The question remains whether the current model is sustainable, and how many great films and filmmakers will be lost in the meantime.", "answers": ["Wonder what happened to iconic film directors like David Lynch, John Waters, and Francis Ford Coppola? Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom. This sea-change has been coming for years now, as an old Forbes piece shows, but some—including Steven Spielberg—believe Hollywood will over-invest in blockbusters: \"There’s going to be an implosion\" where several \"mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm again,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5611}

The spacecraft, which has been traveling for nine and a half years, will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto, providing the first close-up view of the dwarf planet and its five known moons.\n\nPluto, discovered in 1930, is the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system extending beyond Neptune. It was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to its size and orbit. The New Horizons mission aims to shed light on the origins of the solar system and the Kuiper Belt, which is believed to contain trillions of comets and several hundred thousand objects larger than 60 miles across.\n\nThe spacecraft has already delivered data that is a \"gift for the ages,\" according to Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator. The data reveals that Pluto is bigger than previously thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles. This new measurement settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, as Pluto surpasses Eris, another Kuiper Belt inhabitant.\n\nThe new size of Pluto also means that its interior contains more ice than previously estimated, which has implications for the process that formed the binary planet system and the chemistry of the disk of dust, gas, and ice that encircled the sun and provided the building blocks for the planets and their moons.\n\nNew Horizons has also revealed a tremendous diversity between the two planets in the system and their moons, with complex and nuanced surfaces that suggest a history beyond scientists' wildest dreams. The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and alien beauty, with features similar to those on Neptune's moon Triton, which is also thought to be a Kuiper Belt object.\n\nThe spacecraft will take hundreds of observations of Pluto and its moons during the flyby, with the first of the highest-resolution images to be released on Wednesday afternoon.

According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

In her resignation letter, she expresses her frustration with the city council's lack of action to address the housing shortage, despite repeated pleas from residents. Downing and her husband, both professionals (an attorney and a software engineer), currently rent a home in Palo Alto for $6,200 a month. If they were to buy the same home and share it with children, the monthly payment would be $12,177, making it unaffordable even for their combined incomes.\n\nDowning suggests several solutions to increase the housing supply in Palo Alto, such as allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program for housing, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing. She argues that these changes would add desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of the neighborhoods and preserving historic structures.\n\nDowning also points out that the city's focus on office development over housing is exacerbating the problem, as the cost of housing in Palo Alto is driving away teachers, first responders, and service workers. She warns that if the city continues on its current course, it will become a hollowed-out museum, with only wealthy newcomers and long-time landowners remaining.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Palo Alto is not unique, with many other Peninsula towns also refusing to increase housing, leading to a mass exit of working-class residents.

The research, conducted by Elseline Hoekzema and her team at Leiden University in the Netherlands, involved comparing brain scans of women before and after their first pregnancies. The study included 25 Spanish women scanned before and after pregnancy, along with 20 women who did not get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group were consistent and could be detected an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, with most changes still present two years after childbirth.\n\nThe study found that a computer program could accurately identify which women had gotten pregnant based on the MRI scans. The brain changes were not observed in first-time fathers. The researchers believe the changes are likely due to sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman.\n\nThe study suggests that these brain changes may help prepare women for motherhood. For instance, they might help a mother understand the needs of her infant. The women were also given memory tests, and they showed no signs of decline.\n\nFurther analysis linked brain changes to how strongly a woman felt emotionally attached to her infant. When women viewed pictures of their babies, several brain regions that reacted the most were ones that showed pregnancy-related change. These affected brain areas overlapped with circuitry that's involved in figuring out what another person is thinking and feeling, which is a useful ability for a mother tending to an infant.\n\nBruce McEwen of Rockefeller University, who studies hormonal effects on the brain, praised the study, calling it terrific.

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

The success of films like The Avengers, which grossed $1.5 billion at the global box office, allows Disney to generate additional revenue through toy sales, TV spin-offs, and merchandise.

In her resignation letter, she expresses her frustration with the city council's lack of action to address the housing shortage, despite repeated pleas from residents. Downing and her husband, both professionals (an attorney and a software engineer), currently rent a home in Palo Alto for $6,200 a month. If they were to buy the same home and share it with children, the monthly payment would be $12,177, making it unaffordable even for their combined incomes.\n\nDowning suggests several solutions to increase the housing supply in Palo Alto, such as allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program for housing, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing. She argues that these changes would add desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of the neighborhoods and preserving historic structures.\n\nDowning also points out that the city's focus on office development over housing is exacerbating the problem, as the cost of housing in Palo Alto is driving away teachers, first responders, and service workers.

The discrepancy between the current expansion rate and predictions based on measurements of the Big Bang afterglow suggests that there may be unknown physical processes at play or that our understanding of the universe is incomplete. The new Hubble constant, calculated at approximately 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, indicates that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years.\n\nThe research team, led by Nobel Laureate Adam Riess, made this discovery by refining the universe's current expansion rate to an uncertainty of only 2.4 percent. They achieved this by developing innovative techniques to improve the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. The team looked for galaxies containing both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae, using the former's pulsation rates to determine their distance and the latter's brightness to measure their true brightness.\n\nThe new value for the Hubble constant is higher than predictions based on observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. This discrepancy has sparked theories about the nature of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, which make up 95 percent of the universe and do not emit light.\n\nOne possibility is that dark energy, responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be pushing galaxies apart with even greater vigor than scientists believed. Alternatively, dark matter may have some as-yet undiscovered oddities, or there could be a new subatomic particle, similar to neutrinos, traveling close to the speed of light. Another possibility is that Einstein's theory of relativity could be inaccurate.\n\nThe new data were gleaned by analyzing two types of star: Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. The researchers measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars occupying 19 nearby galaxies, compared the apparent brightness of both types of star, and were able to determine the true brightness of the Type Ia supernovae. They then calculated the distance to some 300 Type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies.\n\nThe new findings could challenge", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

The shooting occurred on the eve of the eighth remembrance of the June 18, 2007, Sofa Super Store blaze in West Ashley that killed nine Charleston firefighters. The shooting has sparked national introspection about the availability of guns and renewed politicians' focus on reform of the nation's gun laws. The tragedy has also brought local activists, Charleston's police chief, and South Carolina's governor to tears as they struggle to find words to ease community members who fear further violence in a city with a long and complicated history involving race. The community is mourning and searching for answers, with hundreds packing prayer vigils in a show of solidarity and support for the fallen and the families they left behind.

The discrepancy between the current expansion rate and predictions based on measurements of the Big Bang afterglow suggests that there may be unknown physical processes at play or that our understanding of the universe is incomplete. The new Hubble constant, calculated at approximately 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, indicates that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years.\n\nThe research team, led by Nobel Laureate Adam Riess, made this discovery by refining the universe's current expansion rate to an uncertainty of only 2.4 percent. They achieved this by developing innovative techniques to improve the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. The team looked for galaxies containing both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae, using the former's pulsation rates to determine their distance and the latter's brightness to measure their true brightness.\n\nThe new value for the Hubble constant is higher than predictions based on observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. This discrepancy has sparked theories about the nature of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, which make up 95 percent of the universe and do not emit light.\n\nOne possibility is that dark energy, responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be pushing galaxies apart with even greater vigor than scientists believed. Alternatively, dark matter may have some as-yet undiscovered oddities, or there could be a new subatomic particle, similar to neutrinos, traveling close to the speed of light. Another possibility is that Einstein's theory of relativity could be inaccurate.\n\nThe new data were gleaned by analyzing two types of star: Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. The researchers measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars occupying 19 nearby galaxies, compared the apparent brightness of both types of star, and were able to determine the true brightness of the Type Ia supernovae. They then calculated the distance to some 300 Type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies.\n\nThe new findings could challenge", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years.

Months before the shooting, Zarate was released under San Francisco's \"sanctuary city\" policy, and Trump complained Friday that he \"came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border.\" He added that the \"Schumer/Pelosi Democrats\" are weak on crime and \"will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections.\" Steinle died in the arms of her father, Jim Steinle, who tells the San Francisco Chronicle that the family is shocked and saddened by the verdict. \"Justice was rendered but not served,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4580}
{"pred": "President Donald Trump is embarking on a nine-day, five-country tour, starting May 19, marking his first foreign trip as President. The tour includes visits to the birthplaces of the three Abrahamic faiths - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - in Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican, followed by meetings with NATO leaders in Brussels and the G7 leaders in Sicily. The trip aims to project American power, build relationships with world leaders, and promote a message of unity among Jews, Christians, and Muslims.\n\nThe itinerary includes several key events:\n\n1. Saudi Arabia: Trump will meet with King Salman, attend a royal banquet, and hold bilateral talks. He will also deliver a speech about radical ideology and Islam, which is being drafted by White House aide Stephen Miller.\n\n2. Israel: Trump will meet with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, lay a wreath at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Yad Vashem, and deliver remarks at the Israel Museum. He will also meet privately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and have dinner with him and his wife. Trump will spend time with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, and visit the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and other religious sites.\n\n3. Vatican City: Trump will meet Pope Francis and tour St. Peter’s.\n\n4. Belgium: Trump will meet Belgium’s King Philippe, Prime Minister Charles Michel, and heads of state and government. He will also have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n5. Italy: Trump will attend a G7 meeting on the island of Sicily, where he will discuss trade, terrorism, and the refugee crisis with other leaders.\n\nThe trip comes amidst a series of controversies at home, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the appointment of a special counsel to probe his campaign's ties with Russia. The White House hopes the trip will provide an opportunity to change the subject and make real news.\n\nHowever, the trip has been marred by several incidents, such as Trump allegedly revealing classified intelligence to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, McMaster declining to state that the Western Wall is a part of Israel, and the cancellation of a planned visit and speech at the ancient", "answers": ["\"No president has ever visited the homelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths all on one trip,\" says National Security Adviser HR McMaster—and President Trump's critics say there are probably good reasons why. Trump departs Friday for an ambitious first foreign trip as president that will include Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican, a NATO meeting in Belgium, and the G7 summit in Sicily. A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion. The president's European stops will include meetings with Pope Francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, Time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump for a working lunch May 25. Sources tell the New York Times that Trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and Trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \"Remember, Trump is a nothing if not a showman,\" Hadley says. “He’s been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media.\" Heritage Foundation foreign policy expert James Carofano tells the Washington Post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for Trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in DC. \"The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access,\" he says. \"If you fumble on one of these trips, it’s nobody’s fault but your own.\" Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, disagrees. He tells the AP no other president has made a first foreign trip amid so much controversy. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes,\" he says. Melania Trump will be accompanying her husband on the trip, and her itinerary includes G7 and NATO spousal programs as well as speaking to American military families in Italy, Politico reports. \"This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries,\" she said in a statement Thursday.

{"pred": "The United States Men's National Soccer Team (USMNT) failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup after a shocking 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago on October 10, 2017. This marks the first time since 1986 that the USMNT will not participate in the World Cup. The loss was particularly devastating as the USMNT only needed a draw to secure a spot in the tournament.\n\nThe USMNT's qualification campaign was lackluster, with only three wins in ten games. The team's poor performance was attributed to a combination of factors, including underperformance by the players, questionable tactics by coach Bruce Arena, and systemic issues within the sport in the United States.\n\nArena, who took over as coach in November 2016, was criticized for his close-mindedness in squad selection and tactical naivety. His refusal to prioritize solidity and control in the team's tactics was particularly criticized, as it led to a disjointed performance in Trinidad.\n\nSunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, was also criticized for his handling of the team's management, including his hiring of Jurgen Klinsmann and his failure to invest adequately in youth development. Gulati is facing challenges in his upcoming re-election in February 2018.\n\nThe players were also heavily criticized for their performance, with many considered to be mediocre at best. The team's lack of depth and the absence of a generation of players born in the years 1990-1994 were identified as major issues.\n\nThe loss was particularly damaging for the sport in the United States, as the World Cup is seen as an opportunity to grow the sport's popularity. The USMNT's absence from the tournament will likely have a significant impact on the sport's growth in the country.\n\nFox Sports, which paid $400 million for the English-broadcast rights to the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, is also likely to be affected by the USMNT's absence from the tournament.\n\nThere were also questions raised about the fairness of the qualification process, as Panama's winning goal against Costa", "answers": ["The short version is easy enough: Trinidad and Tobago upset the US Mens National Team in soccer Tuesday night, and the 2-1 loss means that the Americans won't qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986. But just how bad a loss is this? The defeat is \"the most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history,\" writes Grant Wahl for Sports Illustrated. \"Unthinkable,\" declares the New York Times. \"With that loss, the USMNT gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it’s not really close,\" writes Andrew Joseph for USA Today. \"It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years,\" writes Frank Isola at the Daily News. The kicker is that two other games fell the wrong way in unexpected fashion, one on a \"phantom goal,\" sealing the US fate. Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat Mexico, and Panama rallied from one goal back to beat Costa Rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here. The story raises the faint hope that the US could appeal the goal ruling, but it seems unlikely. \"As far as I know, there is no recourse,\" says a US soccer official. Pity Fox Sports: The network paid $200 million, outbidding ESPN, for the rights to televise the 2018 World Cup and showcase teen phenom Christian Pulisic, notes Business Insider.

{"pred": "On June 17, 2015, a white man opened fire during a prayer meeting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Emanuel AME Church) in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine people in an assault that authorities described as a hate crime. The shooting took place at the historic black church, which was founded in 1818 and is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the South. The victims, six females and three males, have not been identified, but it is confirmed that the church's pastor, state Senator Clementa Pinckney, was among the dead. The suspect, a white man in his early 20s, is still at large. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime, and the FBI and state police are assisting in the search for the suspect. The shooting occurred on the eve of the eighth remembrance of the June 18, 2007, Sofa Super Store blaze in West Ashley that killed nine Charleston firefighters. The shooting has sparked national introspection about the availability of guns and renewed politicians' focus on reform of the nation's gun laws. The tragedy has also brought local activists, Charleston's police chief, and South Carolina's governor to tears as they struggle to find words to ease community members who fear further violence in a city with a long and complicated history involving race. The community is mourning and searching for answers, with hundreds packing prayer vigils in a show of solidarity and support for the fallen and the families they left behind. The shooting has also renewed discussions about the history of the church, which was founded by Denmark Vesey, who plotted a failed slave rebellion from the very church in 1822. The church was burned and its members driven underground for decades after the plot was discovered. The church was rebuilt and renamed Emanuel, which means \"God with us.\" The shooting has been widely condemned by politicians and community leaders, with President Obama calling it \"absolutely despicable\" and Attorney General Loretta Lynch declaring that such acts have \"no place in a civilized society.\" The shooting has also prompted federal investigations into potential civil rights violations in the April 4 killing of Walter Scott, a black man shot in the back by a white North Charleston police officer.", "answers": ["\"This is a tragedy that no community should have to experience,\" Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen told reporters after a mass shooting at a historic black church left nine people dead. \"I do believe this was a hate crime,\" he says of the attack, which is believed to have been carried out by a young white man who is still at large. The president of the Charleston NAACP tells the Post and Courier that a survivor says the gunman briefly sat down in the Emanuel AME Church before opening fire on a prayer meeting, but at a news conference this morning, Mullen said the shooter stuck around for almost an hour before the shooting began, the AP reports. Mullen also distributed a surveillance video of a possible suspect and vehicle, and added that the victims were six females and three males. The NAACP chief says the gunman told one woman he was letting her live so she could tell others what happened. \"It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives,\" Mullen told reporters. \"I can assure you that we're going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up and to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.\" Mayor Joe Riley called the suspect \"one hateful person,\" describing the shooting as \"the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine.\" In other developments: Helicopters are circling Charleston in the search for the suspect, who's described as a white male, around 21 years old, slender, clean-shaven, and wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans, and Timberland boots, the Guardian reports. Police say he is \"obviously extremely dangerous.\" State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor, was in the church at the time of the attack, and State House Minority leader Todd Rutherford tells the AP that the lawmaker was among those killed. The 41-year-old \"never had anything bad to say about anybody, even when I thought he should,\" Rutherford says. \"He was always out doing work either for his parishioners or his constituents. He touched everybody.\" The Post and Courier has more on the history of the church, which it calls the \"spiritual home to one of the oldest and largest black congregations south of Baltimore,\" and which many in the city call \"Mother Emanuel.\" Its roots go back to 1816, and it was burned after one of its founders tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Members went underground until after the Civil War, when the church adopted the name \"Emanuel.\" Jeb Bush has canceled a Charleston campaign appearance scheduled for today, the New York Times reports.
