{"pred": "Scott Sears, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles and the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray, has achieved the record of becoming the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo. Sears embarked on a 702-mile trek through harsh Antarctic conditions, including 150mph winds and temperatures as low as -50°C, pulling a sled filled with supplies. His journey, which took 38 days, ended on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will be recognized as a record. The first part of his journey from Hercules Inlet, where sea ice meets land in Antarctica, is considered the most dangerous due to the presence of crevasses. Sears, traveling alone, had to navigate these hazards using skis instead of being roped to a teammate.\n\nDuring his five-week expedition, Sears faced challenges, including hitting a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve. He described this experience as \"bizarre\" as he had been feeling good up until that point. However, after consuming some food and listening to music, he was able to continue his journey.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Sears reached the South Pole in clear skies and expressed his joy in a blog post. He also shared his anticipation for a shower and food upon returning home. Sears has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which were destroyed in the 2015 earthquake.\n\nJudy Murray, Andy's mother, congratulated Sears on his achievement via Twitter. Sears is expected to take a few weeks to fully process his experience, as he has been alone in a tent for nearly six weeks. He is currently waiting for a plane to take him off the South Pole to Union Glacier.", "answers": ["While many people were unwrapping gifts on Christmas Day, the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray was wrapping up a 700-mile, 38-day journey through brutally cold temps and blistering winds—and, he hopes, setting a world record. Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.
