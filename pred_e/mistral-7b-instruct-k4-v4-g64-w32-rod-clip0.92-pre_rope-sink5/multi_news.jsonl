Accused of repeatedly using racial slurs, people began to take screenshots and call her out on it, reports the Houston Chronicle. Hay, her school's varsity cheer captain and yearbook editor, apologized on Twitter at 2am Sunday: \"I admit that I have used language publicly in the past which I am not proud of and that there is no excuse for. Through hard work, education and thanks in large part to the sisterhood that I have come to know through pageants, I am proud to say that I am today a better person.\" Former Miss Teen USA Kamie Crawford issued her own message on Twitter: \"If you win any pageant—first things first. Clean up your page. Because if you're under 21, you shouldn't be drinking and if you're white, the N-word ain't your word.\" The Miss Universe Organization, parent company of Miss Teen USA, tells ABC News that while Hay's language was \"unacceptable at any age,\" she will keep her crown because she \"learned many lessons through those personal struggles that reshaped her life and values.\" Meanwhile, E! News reports that model Chrissy Teigen took issue with the final five, who were all white and blond. \"Wow how can we choose from such a diverse bunch,\" she tweeted, later adding, \"It's fiiiiiine.

Despite the challenges Tunisia faces following its own revolution and previous waves of Libyan refugees, the local population has shown remarkable generosity, with thousands of Tunisians opening their homes to these newcomers. The refugees are living with Tunisian families in Tataouine and neighboring villages, with the majority of the refugees being housed in private homes rather than in refugee camps. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has praised both the Tunisian government and the local population for their response.\n\nMeanwhile, the conflict in Libya has spilled over the border into Tunisia, with Libyan government troops battling rebels for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing. This incursion, while brief and limited, has caused outrage in Tunisia, with the Tunisian Foreign Ministry demanding immediate action to stop the violations. Artillery shells fired by Libyan forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing.\n\nIn the port city of Misrata, the plight of residents has worsened as Libyan forces have been accused of firing bigger rockets, causing greater destruction. Rebels have accused Gaddafi's forces of attacking civilians and have called on NATO to intervene. NATO has been conducting air strikes on Libya since last month under a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the protection of civilians. However, the military deadlock in Libya has exposed growing international rifts, with critics of NATO bombing calling it an attempt to overthrow the government by stretching the terms of the U.N. resolution.\n\nIn other developments, Libyan forces have taken control of the town of Kufra in the remote southeastern desert, but rebels deny that the battle is over. The official Libyan news agency reported that two people were killed and many others were wounded in a NATO attack on a town in the Western Mountains region.\n\nOverall, the situation in both Tunisia and Libya remains fluid and uncertain, with the humanitarian crisis in Tunisia being met with remarkable generosity from the local population, while the conflict in Libya continues to cause destruction and displacement.", "answers": ["Tunisia was not pleased today when a battle between Libya’s warring factions spilled across the border today, after Moammar Gadhafi’s forces attacked a rebel-held frontier crossing.

{"pred": "The news articles highlight the life and philanthropic work of Julius Rosenwald, a Jewish American businessman and the former president of Sears, Roebuck and Co. Born to German Jewish immigrants, Rosenwald started his career as an apprentice in the men's clothing business in New York City. He later partnered with Richard Sears and transformed Sears, Roebuck and Co. into the largest retailer in the country.\n\nRosenwald was not only a successful businessman but also a dedicated philanthropist. He was particularly known for his contributions to African-American education and culture in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build over 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him. These schools, known as Rosenwald schools, played a significant role in the education of thousands of African-American children who would otherwise have been working in the fields instead of attending school.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy extended beyond education. He also supported the careers of prominent African-American artists such as writer Langston Hughes, opera singer Marion Anderson, and painter Jacob Lawrence. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country and developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South.\n\nThe impact of Rosenwald's philanthropy is still felt today. Alex Bethea, a vice principal at an elementary school in New Jersey, recently learned that his school was named after Rosenwald. Bethea, who attended the school as a child, expressed that this revelation helped him understand more about his life and the impact Rosenwald had on his education.\n\nA new documentary, \"Rosenwald,\" directed by Aviva Kempner, tells the little-known story of Rosenwald's contributions to African-American culture and education. The film features interviews with prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), both of whom attended Rosenwald schools. The documentary also highlights Rosenwald's influence from his rabbi, Emil Hirsch, and his connection with Booker T. Washington.\n\nRosenwald's story is seen as an example of American Jewish philanthropy and a call to action for others to continue this tradition. Kempner, the director of the documentary, hopes that the film will inspire others", "answers": ["Julius Rosenwald is well known as the 20th-century American businessman who co-founded what we now call Sears. But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says. More than 80 years after his death, Rosenwald still inspires. \"Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\" says Kempner, but \"we can all do something.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2028}
