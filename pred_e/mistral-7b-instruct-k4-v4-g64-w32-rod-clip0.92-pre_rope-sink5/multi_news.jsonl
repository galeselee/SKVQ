His journey, which took 38 days, ended on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will be recognized as a record. The first part of his journey from Hercules Inlet, where sea ice meets land in Antarctica, is considered the most dangerous due to the presence of crevasses. Sears, traveling alone, had to navigate these hazards using skis instead of being roped to a teammate.\n\nDuring his five-week expedition, Sears faced challenges, including hitting a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve. He described this experience as \"bizarre\" as he had been feeling good up until that point. However, after consuming some food and listening to music, he was able to continue his journey.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Sears reached the South Pole in clear skies and expressed his joy in a blog post. He also shared his anticipation for a shower and food upon returning home. Sears has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which were destroyed in the 2015 earthquake.\n\nJudy Murray, Andy's mother, congratulated Sears on his achievement via Twitter.

The crime has been strongly condemned by the Obama Administration and European officials, and has raised fears of further communal violence.\n\nThe abduction followed a night of mayhem by Jewish extremists, who marched through Jerusalem chanting \"Death to the Arabs\" and assaulting Arab Israelis. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has urged both sides \"not to take the law into your own hands\" and promised to \"uncover quickly who is behind this despicable murder and what motivated it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has begun reinforcing forces on its border with Gaza in response to mortar and rocket fire from Palestinian militants.
