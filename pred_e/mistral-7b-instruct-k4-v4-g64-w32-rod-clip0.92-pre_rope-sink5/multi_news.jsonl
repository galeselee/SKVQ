However, after consuming some food and listening to music, he was able to continue his journey.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Sears reached the South Pole in clear skies and expressed his joy in a blog post.

He was particularly known for his contributions to African-American education and culture in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build over 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him. These schools, known as Rosenwald schools, played a significant role in the education of thousands of African-American children who would otherwise have been working in the fields instead of attending school.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy extended beyond education. He also supported the careers of prominent African-American artists such as writer Langston Hughes, opera singer Marion Anderson, and painter Jacob Lawrence. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country and developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South.\n\nThe impact of Rosenwald's philanthropy is still felt today.

It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

Additionally, the ship construction technique used in the wreck indicates a late 17th or 18th-century ship, rather than the 15th or 16th century.\n\nThe initial discovery of the wreck was made by American explorer Barry Clifford in May, who believed he had found Columbus's flagship. Clifford had pointed out a metallic tube at the site, which he thought could be a cannon, as evidence. However, a team of experts led by the former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, Xavier Nieto Prieto, concluded that the fasteners found at the site indicated a later ship. The metal tube that Clifford had seen during a 2003 expedition was no longer at the site, according to the experts.\n\nUnesco plans to look for the Santa Maria in various locations, both on land and on the seabed. The organization's decision to reject Clifford's site and propose alternatives has been met with controversy.

The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham. The criminal neglect charges are still pending, though Sarah Markham's attorney—Mark O'Mara, who defended George Zimmerman—says he expects they will be dismissed now.

The meeting, which was closed to most of Trump's team, was described as lengthy and cordial, with both leaders expressing a desire to work together. However, the meeting was overshadowed by ongoing concerns about Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nTrump has been under pressure to take a hard line against Russia, but he has been non-committal about whether he believes US intelligence officials who have accused Russia of election meddling. Meanwhile, three US senators wrote to Trump expressing concern about reports that his administration was considering returning diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York that were seized by the Obama administration in response to alleged Russian election meddling.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Putin was expected to focus on Syria, with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stating that Trump wanted to discuss how the two countries can work together to stabilize the war-torn country. Trump is also grappling with a response to North Korea's successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which has been his most pressing foreign policy priority. He is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 to discuss the issue.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that Trump may be looking to reset the US-Russia relationship, while others have expressed concern that Trump may be too eager to find common ground with Putin. The meeting between the two leaders was closely watched, with every facial expression and physical gesture analyzed. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the 2016 US election, and Trump has maintained that his campaign did not collude with Russia.\n\nThe Guardian's Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker wrote that Putin was likely to count the meeting as a win, even if little of substance was discussed. Putin was reportedly pleased with the closed-door format of the meeting, which excluded those in Trump's team who are more skeptical of Russia.
