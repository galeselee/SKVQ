This understanding can help them make better choices about their own careers and overcome the fear of leadership that many girls express.\n\nThe articles also mention the success of Princeton University's proactive efforts to encourage female students to apply for academic prizes and hold visible leadership roles, which resulted in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.

These women either lacked a uterus at birth or lost it due to cancer. The women were able to produce eggs through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the embryos were transferred into their newly transplanted wombs. Dr. Brannstrom anticipates that three to four of the women may successfully give birth, which would be a world first in this field.\n\nPrevious attempts at womb transplants have taken place in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but no recipients have yet given birth. A pregnancy was achieved in Turkey, but it ended after two months. The Swedish team's technique is unique as they are using wombs donated by living relatives or friends of the recipients, while elsewhere, wombs from deceased donors have been used.\n\nThe procedure is controversial due to the risks involved for the donor and ethical questions regarding non-life-saving procedures. The recipients will need to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to prevent rejection of the transplanted womb and will be closely monitored due to concerns about how the physiological changes in the uterus may affect the mother and the growing baby. The transplanted wombs will be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to help women who are unable to conceive due to the loss of their uterus. However, there are still many uncertainties and questions about the long-term effects of the transplanted womb on both the mother and the baby.

In a move to adapt to the digital age and the widespread availability of explicit content online, the magazine will no longer publish fully nude images of women. This decision was made during a meeting with Playboy's founder, Hugh Hefner, who is still listed as editor-in-chief, and was confirmed by Scott Flanders, the company's chief executive.\n\nThe magazine's executives acknowledge that Playboy has been overtaken by the changes it helped to initiate. They argue that the internet has made nudity outdated and that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. The print edition of Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses, but not in a fully nude format.\n\nThis decision marks a significant shift for Playboy, which was founded in 1953 and gained notoriety for its nudity and high-profile interviews. The magazine's website has already removed nudity, a move that has boosted its popularity, with web traffic quadrupling.\n\nPlayboy's logo, featuring a rabbit head wearing a bow tie, is one of the most recognizable in the world. The company makes most of its money from licensing its brand for products such as toiletries, drinks, and jewelry. About 40% of merchandising income is generated in China, where the magazine itself is not available.\n\nThe magazine has a circulation of around 800,000, significantly lower than its pre-Internet peak. By removing nude photos, Playboy hopes to appeal to a broader and younger audience both in print and online. However, this move may alienate the magazine's long-time subscriber base, as some critics argue that the magazine is losing its identity and is no longer serving its original purpose.\n\nPlayboy's interviews with notable figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jimmy Carter, Miles Davis, Vladimir Nabokov, John Lennon, and Yoko Ono have made it culturally and politically significant.

These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's blood, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins.\n\nThe researchers found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This mechanism, while essential for the fish's survival in freezing temperatures, may have unintended consequences. The ice crystals can persist inside the fish's body even during summer warming episodes, potentially causing damage to the fish's capillaries and organs, such as the spleen.\n\nThe researchers studied the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions and discovered the anti-melting properties of AFPs after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. They also found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species' icy veins, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives.\n\nThe study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides a better understanding of the progression of all species, as it shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with it.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fish species, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's blood, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins.\n\nThe researchers found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This mechanism, while essential for the fish's survival in freezing temperatures, may have unintended consequences. The ice crystals can persist inside the fish's body even during summer warming episodes, potentially causing damage to the fish's capillaries and organs, such as the spleen.\n\nThe researchers studied the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions and discovered the anti-melting properties of AFPs after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. They also found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species' icy veins, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives.\n\nThe study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides a better understanding of the progression of all species, as it shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with it.

The find, a stone tool made from orange agate, was discovered at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley, and is believed to be older than any known site of human occupation in the region. The tool was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens, which has been dated to 15,800 years ago. If the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and older than the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America.\n\nThe discovery was made by archaeologists from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, who have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011. Their discoveries include stone projectile points, tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel, and the stone tool. A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo.\n\nThe discovery has been met with skepticism from some in the scientific community, who are waiting for the findings to be published in a scientific journal and for further evidence to be uncovered. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses, and bison roamed the area.

The find, a stone tool made from orange agate, was discovered at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley, and is believed to be older than any known site of human occupation in the region. The tool was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens, which has been dated to 15,800 years ago. If the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and older than the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America.\n\nThe discovery was made by archaeologists from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, who have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011. Their discoveries include stone projectile points, tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel, and the stone tool. A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo.\n\nThe discovery has been met with skepticism from some in the scientific community, who are waiting for the findings to be published in a scientific journal and for further evidence to be uncovered. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses, and bison roamed the area. The find has the potential to significantly alter our understanding of the early human history of North America.\n\nThe University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers, and volunteers invaluable field experience as they continue to excavate the site and search for further evidence to support the claim that the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter is home to one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States.", "answers": ["A small stone tool unearthed in eastern Oregon appears to be so ancient that the history of humans in the area may have to be rewritten, archaeologists say.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has been in decline for several years, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but it is believed to be a combination of natural fluctuations in the ocean environment and overfishing.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is causing concern as it could lead to a food shortage for various marine predators, potentially leading to their starvation. The decline has already been linked to the malnourishment of sea lion pups along the West Coast.\n\nThe PFMC is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington. They are urged to take immediate action to protect the sardine population and the overall health of the West Coast ecosystem. This includes setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.\n\nFor further information, readers are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish, and the PFMC can be contacted at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov. The sardine fishing industry is also struggling due to the decline, with fishermen returning to port without a catch after spending significant amounts of time and resources.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, but the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. If the sardine population does not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years. The PFMC's actions are crucial in ensuring the health of the West Coast ecosystem and the sustainability of the fishing industry.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has been in decline for several years, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but it is believed to be a combination of natural fluctuations in the ocean environment and overfishing.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is causing concern as it could lead to a food shortage for various marine predators, potentially leading to their starvation. The decline has already been linked to the malnourishment of sea lion pups along the West Coast.\n\nThe PFMC is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington. They are urged to take immediate action to protect the sardine population and the overall health of the West Coast ecosystem. This includes setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.\n\nFor further information, readers are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish, and the PFMC can be contacted at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov. The sardine fishing industry is also struggling due to the decline, with fishermen returning to port without a catch after spending significant amounts of time and resources.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, but the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. If the sardine population does not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years. The PFMC's actions are crucial in ensuring the health of the West Coast ecosystem and the sustainability of the fishing industry.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings, such as doctors' offices and emergency rooms, are unnecessary. This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011, which represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in the United States. The studies found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the U.S. result in an antibiotic prescription, with more than 44% of these prescriptions written for patients with acute respiratory conditions. Half of these prescriptions are deemed unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs.

To achieve this, health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole are encouraged to take action, such as evaluating prescribing habits, implementing stewardship activities, providing expertise and resources, assisting in data collection and analysis, and tracking antibiotic prescribing at the national level.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts are also preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing, which", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times.

Others have shared stories of memorable moments, such as Miguel Cabrera's impressive play, where he hit a single on an attempted intentional walk.\n\nHowever, some argue that the rule change will have minimal impact on the pace of play, as intentional walks only took an estimated 35 seconds per game in 2016. Critics also suggest that the rule change is not worth the effort, given its insignificant impact on game duration.\n\nIn response to the rule change, some have proposed more entertaining alternatives, such as having the center fielder throw the intentional walk or requiring the manager to perform a dance as the signal for an intentional walk. These suggestions aim to maintain the theatrics associated with the intentional walk while potentially speeding up the game.\n\nIn the digital sphere, users continue to engage with location-based Tweets, while baseball fans and players grapple with the loss of a tradition, albeit one that may not have had a significant impact on gameplay.", "answers": ["Those who complain baseball is too slow may be heartened to hear a quicker pace is on its way.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings, such as doctors' offices and emergency rooms, are unnecessary. This equates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually, primarily for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011, which represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in the United States. The studies found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the U.S. result in an antibiotic prescription, with more than 44% of these prescriptions written for patients with acute respiratory conditions. Half of these prescriptions are deemed unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs. The CDC has warned about the rise of these superbugs, which pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. In response, the White House announced an aggressive plan in 2014 to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, setting a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020.\n\nBased on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15%, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. To achieve this, health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole are encouraged to take action, such as evaluating prescribing habits, implementing stewardship activities, providing expertise and resources, assisting in data collection and analysis, and tracking antibiotic prescribing at the national level.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts are also preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing, which", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}
{"pred": "The unemployment insurance system in the United States is facing a crisis due to the surge in unemployment and, in some cases, poor planning. As of last year, a record 20 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits, and thirty states have depleted their funds, forcing them to borrow from the federal government, raise taxes on employers, or reduce benefits. The situation is worsening in many other states.\n\nTo provide insights into the health of each state's unemployment insurance trust fund and its impact on citizens, a news application has been developed. This application offers near real-time data on state revenues and benefits paid out, allowing users to click on a state for the latest information, historical data, and details on tax increases and benefit cuts. However, it is important to note that this news application is no longer being updated as of February 3, 2011, but the historical data remains accurate.\n\nIn Virginia, the unemployment insurance trust fund has been drained, leading to increased taxes on employers and reduced benefits for seniors. Business owners, like Don Miller, are concerned about the added expense of hiring due to the tax increase. Meanwhile, seniors like James Hay are facing reduced benefits, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe situation is not unique to Virginia. Many states are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have implemented politically difficult tax increases or benefit cuts. Some states, such as Virginia, let their trust funds dwindle below the recommended 18 months of reserves, making it necessary to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors.\n\nEconomist Gary Burtless from the Brookings Institution argues that increasing taxes on employers during a recession is counterproductive, as it may contribute to joblessness rather than stimulating the economy. On the other hand, Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, contends that cutting unemployment benefits undermines the fundamental goals of the program, which are to boost the economy and keep people out of poverty during an economic downturn.\n\nIn conclusion, the unemployment insurance system in the United States is in crisis due to high unemployment and, in some cases, poor planning.

Cruz and Lee are insisting on an amendment that would allow insurance companies to sell any kind of health plan they want as long as they offer at least one that complies with federal regulations.\n\nCritics argue that this amendment could lead to higher costs for older and sicker people, as healthier people might flock to cheaper, bare-bones plans. The main insurer trade group, America’s Health Insurance Plans, warned that the Cruz-Lee amendment could lead to higher costs for those with pre-existing conditions. McConnell can only afford two defections if he is to pass the bill, as Republicans control 52 seats.\n\nSenator Rand Paul is expected to oppose the bill, and many observers also believe it will be impossible to win support from Senator Susan Collins. Despite the tough odds, there seems to be a \"more positive feeling\" that the motion to proceed to the bill will pass next week. However, several Republican senators have expressed frustration with McConnell's strategy of keeping the details of the bill secret until the last minute.\n\nSenators Mike Rounds and Bill Cassidy are negotiating with Cruz and Lee to modify their amendment to gather at least 50 votes on the floor. Rounds, a former insurance executive, has proposed setting a ratio for how much insurers could charge people for plans meeting federal requirements versus the lower charge for cheaper, simpler plans. McConnell has scheduled a special meeting of the conference at 11", "answers": ["President Trump has warned senators that he will be \"very angry\" if they fail to repeal ObamaCare as promised. In an interview with televangelist Pat Robertson, the president said \"a lot of people will be very upset\" if Senate Republicans don't pass the legislation this summer, Politico reports. \"I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me,\" Trump said. \"It has to get passed. They have to do it. They have to get together and get it done.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is expected to present a revised version of the bill to senators Thursday morning, \"has to pull it off,\" Trump said. \"He's working very hard. He's got to pull it off.\" McConnell urged senators Wednesday to drop procedural objections to the bill and let a vote move forward, saying, \"If we sit on our hands, families will continue to suffer,\" the Hill reports. McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes, and Sen. Rand Paul said Wednesday that he can't support the revised bill because it is \"the same as the old bill, except it leaves in place more taxes,\" the Washington Post reports. McConnell also faces opposition from moderate senators and conservatives including Sen. Ted Cruz, who's pushing for an amendment that would allow insurance companies to sell plans that don't meet federal coverage requirements.
