This understanding can help them make better choices about their own careers and overcome the fear of leadership that many girls express.\n\nThe articles also mention the success of Princeton University's proactive efforts to encourage female students to apply for academic prizes and hold visible leadership roles, which resulted in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.

These women either lacked a uterus at birth or lost it due to cancer. The women were able to produce eggs through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the embryos were transferred into their newly transplanted wombs. Dr. Brannstrom anticipates that three to four of the women may successfully give birth, which would be a world first in this field.\n\nPrevious attempts at womb transplants have taken place in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but no recipients have yet given birth. A pregnancy was achieved in Turkey, but it ended after two months. The Swedish team's technique is unique as they are using wombs donated by living relatives or friends of the recipients, while elsewhere, wombs from deceased donors have been used.\n\nThe procedure is controversial due to the risks involved for the donor and ethical questions regarding non-life-saving procedures. The recipients will need to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to prevent rejection of the transplanted womb and will be closely monitored due to concerns about how the physiological changes in the uterus may affect the mother and the growing baby. The transplanted wombs will be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to help women who are unable to conceive due to the loss of their uterus. However, there are still many uncertainties and questions about the long-term effects of the transplanted womb on both the mother and the baby.

In a move to adapt to the digital age and the widespread availability of explicit content online, the magazine will no longer publish fully nude images of women. This decision was made during a meeting with Playboy's founder, Hugh Hefner, who is still listed as editor-in-chief, and was confirmed by Scott Flanders, the company's chief executive.\n\nThe magazine's executives acknowledge that Playboy has been overtaken by the changes it helped to initiate. They argue that the internet has made nudity outdated and that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. The print edition of Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses, but not in a fully nude format.\n\nThis decision marks a significant shift for Playboy, which was founded in 1953 and gained notoriety for its nudity and high-profile interviews. The magazine's website has already removed nudity, a move that has boosted its popularity, with web traffic quadrupling.\n\nPlayboy's logo, featuring a rabbit head wearing a bow tie, is one of the most recognizable in the world. The company makes most of its money from licensing its brand for products such as toiletries, drinks, and jewelry. About 40% of merchandising income is generated in China, where the magazine itself is not available.\n\nThe magazine has a circulation of around 800,000, significantly lower than its pre-Internet peak. By removing nude photos, Playboy hopes to appeal to a broader and younger audience both in print and online. However, this move may alienate the magazine's long-time subscriber base, as some critics argue that the magazine is losing its identity and is no longer serving its original purpose.\n\nPlayboy's interviews with notable figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jimmy Carter, Miles Davis, Vladimir Nabokov, John Lennon, and Yoko Ono have made it culturally and politically significant.

These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's blood, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's veins.\n\nThe researchers found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This mechanism, while essential for the fish's survival in freezing temperatures, may have unintended consequences. The ice crystals can persist inside the fish's body even during summer warming episodes, potentially causing damage to the fish's capillaries and organs, such as the spleen.\n\nThe researchers studied the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions and discovered the anti-melting properties of AFPs after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. They also found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species' icy veins, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives.\n\nThe study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides a better understanding of the progression of all species, as it shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with it.

{"pred": "In the aftermath of the deadly shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, two Jewish medical professionals, including a registered nurse named Ari Mahler, treated the suspect, Robert Bowers, at Allegheny General Hospital. Dr. Jeff Cohen, the hospital's president and a member of the Tree of Life Congregation, praised the Jewish medical staff for their professionalism in treating Bowers despite their personal connections to the victims.\n\nMahler, the registered nurse, shared his experience in a lengthy Facebook post, describing Bowers as confused and lost rather than evil. He speculated that Bowers was a lonely, easily influenced individual who sought attention. Mahler did not reveal his Jewish identity to Bowers during their interactions, but he did mention that Bowers yelled \"Death to all Jews\" as he was being wheeled into the emergency room.\n\nMahler, the son of Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler who retired as rabbi of Temple Emanuel of South Hills, shared his own experiences with anti-Semitism growing up, including bullying and hateful messages. He also discussed his decision to downplay his Jewish identity as a defense mechanism.\n\nBefore becoming a nurse, Mahler worked as a loan officer and a financial consultant. He graduated from the University of Maryland with a BA in English and later earned his nursing degree from the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nCohen, the hospital president, met with Mahler after his emotional encounter with Bowers and praised him for his professionalism. Cohen also expressed his own feelings about the shooting, describing the Tree of Life Congregation as a safe place where people gather to pray and socialize. He knew several of the victims personally, including the Rosenthal brothers, who were handicapped and attended services nearly every day.\n\nCohen became curious about meeting Bowers and wanted to form his own impression of the suspect. He concluded that Bowers was not the embodiment of evil, but rather a lost individual who had committed a heinous act.\n\nMahler concluded his Facebook post with a plea for love in the face of evil, emphasizing the power of love as an action and its ability to give hope and reaffirm humanity. He encouraged readers to remember the importance of love in their own lives.", "answers": ["An Allegheny General Hospital nurse who treated Robert Bowers, the man suspected of killing 11 at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, after the shooting has stepped forward via a public Facebook post, and he clarifies his identity: \"I am The Jewish Nurse.\" His name is Ari Mahler, and per TribLIVE, he and an ER doctor were two Jewish medical professionals who tended to Bowers, even after he was reportedly wheeled into the hospital yelling, \"Death to all Jews.\" In his post, Mahler doesn't get into too many specifics about his interaction with Bowers, citing privacy laws, but he reveals how as a kid—he was one of four children of a rabbi, per Heavy.com—he dealt with anti-Semitism, and that even as an adult he plays his religion down as a deflection. He notes he didn't tell Bowers he was Jewish, instead choosing to \"show him empathy.\" And also \"love.\" \"I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish [to] instill in you,\" he writes. Mahler, who initially worried his own parents could've been among the synagogue victims, says what happened didn't shock him and that \"it’s only a matter of time before the next one happens,\" adding although \"my heart yearns for change … today's climate doesn't foster nurturing, tolerance, or civility.\" He also notes he didn't see \"evil\" when he looked into Bowers' eyes, but \"something else.\" Hospital President Jeff Cohen, who said Mahler came to him in tears after treating Bowers, concurs. \"He's a very lost guy,\" Cohen says of Bowers, per TribLIVE, but \"he's not the face of the devil. He's just a guy who committed a very heinous act.\" Read Mahler's post here. (Also working off of love: Muslims raising money for victims of the shooting.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2672}
