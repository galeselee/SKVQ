{"pred": "The report discusses the complexities and risks associated with the global supply chains of information systems used by federal agencies. The supply chains for these systems can be long, complex, and globally distributed, making it difficult for agencies to understand and control how technology is developed, integrated, and deployed. This complexity, combined with the reliance on foreign manufacturing for IT equipment, presents significant risks to the security, integrity, and resilience of federal information systems.\n\nThe report highlights several potential threats that could create unacceptable risks for federal agencies, including the installation of malicious logic or counterfeit hardware or software, disruptions in the production or distribution of critical products, reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers, and the installation of hardware or software with unintentional vulnerabilities. These threats can be introduced at various points in the global supply chain and can lead to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and associated information.\n\nTo address these risks, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. The act also assigns the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the responsibility for providing standards and guidelines on information security to agencies. NIST has issued several special publications that provide guidance on managing supply chain risk, including guidelines on conducting due diligence reviews of suppliers, developing acquisition policy, and implementing procedures to protect against supply chain threats throughout the system development life cycle.\n\nThe report notes that while the Department of Defense has made significant progress in addressing supply chain risks for its information systems, other agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of Energy, and Department of Homeland Security have made limited progress. The report makes several recommendations to these agencies to help them better address IT supply chain-related security risks, including developing and implementing departmental policy and procedures to define and implement supply chain protection measures, and developing and implementing a monitoring capability to verify compliance with and assess the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nThe report concludes that the global IT supply chain introduces a myriad of security risks to federal information systems, and that it is important and urgent for federal agencies to appropriately assess, manage, and monitor IT supply chain risk as part of their agency-wide information security programs. The report emphasizes the potential for serious adverse impact on an agency's operations, assets, and employees if these risks are not addressed.", "answers": ["IT systems are essential to the operations of the federal government. The supply chain—the set of organizations, people, activities, and resources that create and move a product from suppliers to end users—for IT systems is complex and global in scope. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IT supply chain is a continuing threat. Federal security guidelines provide for managing the risks to the supply chain. This testimony statement highlights information security risks associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT systems. The statement also summarizes GAO's 2012 report that assessed the extent to which four national security-related agencies had addressed such risks. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previous reports, as well as information provided by the national security-related agencies on their actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations. GAO also reviewed federal information security guidelines and directives. Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal information systems. Supply chain threats are present during the various phases of an information system's development life cycle and could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies. Information technology (IT) supply chain-related threats are varied and can include: installation of intentionally harmful hardware or software (i.e., containing “malicious logic”); installation of counterfeit hardware or software; failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products; reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers for the performance of technical services; and installation of hardware or software containing unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defective code. These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of materials needed to develop systems. These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include the acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; inadequate testing of software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain. GAO reported in 2012 that the four national security-related agencies in its review—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. Of the four agencies, Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. It had defined and implemented supply chain protection controls, and initiated efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Conversely, Energy and DHS had not developed or documented policies and procedures that defined security measures for protecting against IT supply chain threats and had not developed capabilities for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. Although Justice had defined supply chain protection measures, it also had not developed or documented procedures for implementing or monitoring the measures. Energy and Justice fully implemented the recommendations that GAO made in its 2012 report and resolved the deficiencies that GAO had identified with their supply chain risk management efforts by 2016. DHS also fully implemented two recommendations to document policies and procedures for defining and implementing security measures to protect against supply chain threats by 2015, but could not demonstrate that it had fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to assess the effectiveness of the security measures. In its 2012 report, GAO recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The departments generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3092}
{"pred": "The report, issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), examines the extent to which federal agencies (Health and Human Services, Department of Labor, and Department of Justice) awarded grants to faith-based organizations (FBOs) under programs with statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring from 2007 to 2015.\n\nThe report found that HHS did not award any grants to nonprofit organizations under the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, which is subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. The Department of Labor (DOL) identified 18 grant programs with such restrictions, of which 931 grantees were awarded grants, including 19 potential FBOs. The Department of Justice (DOJ) identified at least 34 relevant grant programs, of which 604 grantees were awarded grants, including 25 potential FBOs that certified they were exempt from religious-based hiring provisions.\n\nOf the 9 exempted grantees, 8 received funding from DOJ grant programs from 2008 to 2010, totaling approximately $3.2 million, which is less than 1% of the $804 million in grants that DOJ awarded during that period. The remaining exempted grantee received a funding award in 2015. The six grantees interviewed stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission and organizational success, and they would not have sought the grant or would have needed executive-level approval to apply for the grant if the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) exemption was not available to them.\n\nThe report also found that 35 potential faith-based grantees that received funding in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and that agencies reported had not filed a self-certification to be exempted from religious-based hiring restrictions were not aware of the exemption option. The agencies (DOJ, DOL, and HHS) inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions through grant announcements. The agencies also provide information on their web pages regarding how FBOs may certify that they are exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring", "answers": ["The federal government provides billions of dollars in grant funding to organizations offering social services, including FBOs. In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring. GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption. GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites. All three agencies require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions. For example, DOJ, DOL, and HHS have policies requiring grantees to submit their exemption self-certification, but only DOL reviews exemption requests and either approves them or provides a reason for denial."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2968}

{"pred": "The report, issued by a government agency, provides an analysis of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seizures of potentially harmful items at U.S. borders from 2012 to 2016. The majority of seizures, approximately 70%, were made from international mail and 30% from express cargo. The seized items were categorized as either drugs or merchandise, with 47% being illegal or inadmissible drugs and 53% being merchandise. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, was not seized until 2016, when a specific category code was added to the Seized Asset and Case Tracking System (SEACATS). In 2016, CBP recorded 53 fentanyl seizures via both mail and express cargo.\n\nThe report also discusses the use of Electronic Advance Data (EAD) by the United States Postal Service (USPS) and express consignment operators to provide items to CBP for inspection. USPS does not currently provide EAD for inbound international mail, relying on foreign postal operators to do so voluntarily. In March 2017, USPS data indicated that EAD was available for roughly half of all inbound international mail.\n\nTwo pilot programs were initiated in 2014 and 2015 at the New York International Service Center to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. The pilots have been ongoing, with USPS providing about 82% and 58% of targeted mail for CBP inspection. However, challenges in locating targeted mail once it arrives at an International Service Center have been reported.\n\nThe report highlights the lack of clear performance goals for these pilots and the need for an analysis to determine if they are achieving desired outcomes. The Department of Homeland Security has concurred with this recommendation and plans to implement it by February 28, 2018.\n\nThe report also raises questions about the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection. While it could potentially decrease time and resources needed for the screening process and increase security, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known. USPS has not calculated the current costs of collecting EAD from countries with which it has data-", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes information contained in GAO's August 2017 report, entitled International Mail Security: Costs and Benefits of Using Electronic Data to Screen Mail Need to Be Assessed ( GAO-17-606 ). U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary federal agency tasked with targeting and inspecting inbound international items and seizing illegal goods, including illegal or inadmissible drugs and merchandise. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and express consignment operators (such as FedEx and DHL) provide items to CBP for inspection. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with electronic advance data (EAD), such as the shipper's and recipient's name and address, for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement. In 2014 and 2015, USPS and CBP initiated two pilot programs at the New York International Service Center (ISC) to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. Under the pilots, CBP uses EAD to target a small number of pieces of mail each day. According to USPS officials, when USPS employees scan either individual targeted pieces or larger sacks containing this targeted mail, they are alerted that CBP has targeted the item and set the item or sack aside for inspection. According to USPS and CBP, USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection because locating targeted mail once it arrives at an ISC has been a challenge. Since the pilots began, USPS has provided CBP with about 82 percent of targeted mail for one pilot, and about 58 percent of targeted mail for the other. However, while USPS and CBP have collected some performance information for these pilots (including the percentage of targeted mail provided for inspection), this information is not linked to a specific performance target agreed upon by USPS and CBP--such as a specific percentage of targeted mail provided to CBP for inspection. Further, the agencies have not conducted an analysis to determine if the pilot programs are achieving desired outcomes. Because CBP and USPS lack clear performance goals for these pilots, they risk spending additional time and resources expanding them prior to fully assessing the pilots' success or failure. In our report we found that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing time and resources needed for the screening process--potentially decreasing costs--and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. For example, CBP has collected data on the percentage of inspections resulting in a seizure for mail inspected as a result of targeting in the pilot programs at the New York ISC. However, CBP does not collect comparable data for seizures resulting from inspections conducted based on current methods of choosing mail for inspection. In light of the challenges that collecting and using these data present, it is important that CBP and USPS carefully consider actions to enhance inbound international mail security to avoid wasting time and money on potentially ineffective and costly endeavors. In our report, we recommended that CBP, in coordination with USPS: (1) establish measureable performance goals to assess pilot programs and (2) evaluate the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection compared with other targeting methods. CBP and USPS agreed with these recommendations and CBP plans to implement them by February 28, 2018."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2565}

The Navy has requested funding for the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program for FY2020. The report highlights several issues for Congress to consider, including whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request, the number of oilers needed to support Navy operations in the future, and whether to encourage the Navy to equip TAO-205s with more self-defense equipment.\n\nThe primary role of fleet oilers is to transfer fuel to Navy surface ships, extending their operating endurance. The Navy's existing fleet of 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class oilers, procured between 1982 and 1989, will reach the end of their 35-year service life between 2021 and 2026. The TAO-205 class, with capabilities similar to the Kaiser-class ships, will replace these vessels.
