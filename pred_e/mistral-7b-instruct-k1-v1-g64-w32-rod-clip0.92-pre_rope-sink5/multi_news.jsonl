Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.

A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot \"can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence.

But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked.

She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel—who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945—says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections. Authorities say Meisel and several other Stutthof survivors in the US could be called as witnesses if the former guards are deemed healthy enough to stand trial.

Accused of repeatedly using racial slurs, people began to take screenshots and call her out on it, reports the Houston Chronicle. Hay, her school's varsity cheer captain and yearbook editor, apologized on Twitter at 2am Sunday: \"I admit that I have used language publicly in the past which I am not proud of and that there is no excuse for.

But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says. More than 80 years after his death, Rosenwald still inspires. \"Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\" says Kempner, but \"we can all do something.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2028}

They also searched the homes of six people—including, reportedly, suspect Michael Adebolajo's father's home. Neither these two conspirators nor the wounded alleged killers have been charged yet. Other developments include: Police also haven't identified any of the suspects, but Adebolajo's name was widely reported yesterday, and today the Telegraph has identified the other alleged knife-man as the confusingly similarly named Michael Adebowale, 22. Neighbors identified Adebowale after police armed with submachine guns raided his flat yesterday, emerging with two children, a baby, and two large envelopes. Adebowale was apparently known for distributing radical Islamist leaflets, and his girlfriend had recently converted to Islam. \"When you walked past, you would hear them singing Muslim songs,\" one neighbor says, adding that she \"saw the man who was in the video go inside the house. I think he was a boyfriend.\" Rigby, \"was due to come up this weekend,\" his wife tells the Guardian. \"You don't expect it to happen when he's in the UK. You think they're safe.\" The Daily Mirror has uncovered video that purports to show the two suspects rushing at police and getting shot. There's also been a great deal of hand-wringing over MI5's failure to identify the stabbers ahead of time. David Cameron is calling for an investigation to determine \"what went wrong\" at the intelligence agency. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has promised just such an investigation.

Two decades ago, it was enough to get young girls in the workplace and \"demystify\" the whole concept of women getting a job. Now it's time to introduce girls to the executive suites, to give them role models of women as decision-makers. Girls still tend not to see themselves getting leadership positions as adults, and that's because they don't get to see enough real-life examples. \"Simply showing our daughters what an office looks like is no longer enough,\" writes Allen. \"Real breakthroughs will come when we bring girls inside the halls of power. We need to take our daughters into the C-Suite now so they can lead in the future.\" Click to read her entire column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1555}

A Pennsylvania couple is accused of stealing $1,049.26 of food and other goods from a grocery store on Saturday afternoon—with the intention of serving said food to guests at their 5:30pm wedding reception. Arthur Phillips, 32, and Brittany Lurch, 22, were married two days before they walked into a Wegmans to \"shop\" for what a source told the Smoking Gun included a shrimp platter, two spiral hams, a veggie tray, and soda, among other edibles. Other crucial reception items included a punch bowl, forks and spoons, and, in a sign that there's nothing like one-stop shopping, a polo shirt and Gillette Fusion razor blades. The most brainiac part? According to the criminal complaint, the duo pushed one cart out of the store ... then went right back in and starting filling up a second cart. The Centre Daily Times reports that when police arrested the pair, they also found a pipe with pot residue in the couple's car. The groom apparently took the fall for his new bride, and was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia; both were hit with theft-related charges."], "all_classes": null, "length": 696}

Shaneice Luke, Rose's sister, filed a lawsuit accusing the staff of killing her brother, who \"became unresponsive\" after at least three staff members allegedly threw him to the ground and put him in a \"prone position\" for as long as 30 minutes; one 275-pound worker sat on him, while others, including doctors and nurses, stood by, the New York Daily News reports. Rose, who had severe autism and could not communicate verbally, \"was basically crushed to death,\" says Luke's lawyer. But now, New York officials are billing Luke for $11.67 million, the AP reports. The claim against Rose's estate cites his total Medicaid assistance over a period of 10 years, up until the day he died at age 33. Medicaid doesn't typically demand reimbursement, but an attorney who has worked with others who've received similar bills after suing the state says officials have recently begun this \"problematic\" practice. A spokesperson for the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, which runs Fineson, says officials are simply following federal Medicaid obligations so that they don't lose their Medicaid funding, but an assemblyman who advocates for people with disabilities calls it \"retaliation.\" Last year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced plans to close Fineson in 2017."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1223}
