This includes introducing girls to female role models, explaining the responsibilities and rewards of leadership, and providing opportunities for girls to interact with successful women.

The death was investigated, but no criminal charges were filed.\n\nThe victim's sister, Shaneice Luke, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the facility and the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities. In response, the state agency sent Luke a bill for $11.67 million, citing the total Medicaid assistance provided to Rose from 2002 to 2012. The agency claims it is following federal Medicaid obligations by seeking reimbursement, but critics argue that the bill is retaliation for Luke's lawsuit.\n\nAssemblyman Harvey Weisenberg called the bill \"an outrage\" and \"retaliation\" against Luke, who lost her brother due to alleged abuse.

The discovery highlights the complex and often paradoxical nature of evolutionary innovations, where", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady says the team plans to keep excavating the site after the \"tantalizing\" find, which may be older than any other find predating the Clovis people once thought to be the first in North America, NBC News reports. University of Washington professor of archaeology Donald K. Grayson, however, predicts there will be a lot of skepticism about the find. \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he tells the AP. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" (Experts believe they have found evidence of a long-lost civilization in the Honduran rainforest.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1460}

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is being urged to set conservative catch limits and prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean ecosystem.\n\nThe decline of sardines is not a new phenomenon, as their populations have fluctuated widely in the past due to natural climate cycles and overfishing. However, the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a natural climate cycle, is believed to be a contributing factor, as it has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, which has repelled sardines.\n\nThe decline of sardines is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many predators, including brown pelicans, sea lions, and sharks, struggling to find food. Environmental groups are calling for a halt to sardine fishing until the population recovers, while scientists are working to understand the causes of the decline and how to mitigate its effects.\n\nIn related news, a recent assessment found that the sardine population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has also declined.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same.

The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The Clarion Nightsnake, also known as the Clarion Island Snake, was first spotted in 1936 by American naturalist William Beebe on the Revillagigedo Islands, off Mexico's Pacific coast. Despite subsequent searches, no further sightings were reported, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries.\n\nHowever, a team of researchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and the Mexican Institute of Ecology led by Daniel Mulcahy and Juan Martinez Gomez suspected that the snake might still exist. They timed their expedition in May to replicate Beebe's original steps and used his field notes as a guide. After weeks of searching, one of the researchers' graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, spotted one of the snakes, marking the first sighting since 1936.\n\nDNA analysis confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake is a distinct species, most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast, over 500 miles away. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey to the island on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also due to the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands are home to a small detachment of Mexican marines, and the island's ecosystem is vulnerable to external threats. The National Museum of Natural History has recognized the snake as a full species, and plans to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the island's delicate ecosystem.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity.

The patient's brother has also developed symptoms similar to Marburg, and 11 people who came into contact with the victim have tested negative for the virus. The Ugandan Ministry of Health has quarantined 80 people who had contact with the victim, including 60 health-care workers.\n\n**Symptoms and Transmission**\n\nMarburg virus has an incubation period of 5-10 days, and symptoms include fever, headache, myalgia, and hemorrhaging. The virus is not airborne and is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or animal. Fruit bats and their guano are believed to be the natural reservoir of the virus.\n\n**History of Outbreaks**\n\nMarburg virus was first identified in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia after laboratory workers handling African green monkeys imported from Uganda contracted the virus. Since then, there have been several outbreaks, including a large outbreak in 1998 that infected 154 people and killed 128, and another outbreak in 2004 that infected 252 people and killed 227.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Marburg, but hospitalized patients can receive general supportive therapy, including fluid replacement and blood transfusions. Experimental treatments are being developed, including a drug tested on lab monkeys infected with a deadly strain of Marburg.\n\n**Uganda's Response**\n\nThe Ugandan government has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The country's Prime Minister has stated that Uganda has experience and capacity to deal with the outbreak and that the World Health Organization has been informed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Marburg is a deadly virus, it is not particularly easy to catch, and if an outbreak is identified early and controlled, it is unlikely to escalate like the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

The move has been met with widespread opposition from environmental groups, Native American tribes, and some local residents. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to designate national monuments, but critics argue that Trump's decision is illegal and ignores the will of the people.\n\nThe Bears Ears National Monument, which was designated by President Barack Obama in 2016, covers 1.35 million acres of land in southeastern Utah and is home to over 100,000 archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. The monument was designated to protect the land from mining and drilling, but Trump's decision has opened up the area to new development.\n\nThe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, which was designated by President Bill Clinton in 1996, covers 1.7 million acres of land in southern Utah and is home to scenic cliffs, canyons, and waterfalls. Trump's decision has reduced the size of the monument by nearly half, allowing for more development and drilling.\n\nThe decision has been met with outrage from Native American tribes, who have filed lawsuits to challenge the decision. The Hopi, Ute, and Zuni tribes have joined forces to sue the Trump administration, arguing that the decision is illegal and ignores their rights to the land.\n\nEnvironmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have also filed lawsuits to challenge the decision. The groups argue that the decision is illegal and ignores the will of the people, who have spoken out against the development of the area.\n\nThe decision has also been met with criticism from some local residents, who argue that the monument is a threat to their livelihoods and way of life. Some residents have expressed concerns about the impact of the monument on local jobs and the economy.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a national debate about the role of public lands in the United States and the balance between development and conservation.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands.
