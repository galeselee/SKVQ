This includes introducing girls to female role models, explaining the responsibilities and rewards of leadership, and providing opportunities for girls to interact with successful women.

The death was investigated, but no criminal charges were filed.\n\nThe victim's sister, Shaneice Luke, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the facility and the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities. In response, the state agency sent Luke a bill for $11.67 million, citing the total Medicaid assistance provided to Rose from 2002 to 2012. The agency claims it is following federal Medicaid obligations by seeking reimbursement, but critics argue that the bill is retaliation for Luke's lawsuit.\n\nAssemblyman Harvey Weisenberg called the bill \"an outrage\" and \"retaliation\" against Luke, who lost her brother due to alleged abuse.

The discovery highlights the complex and often paradoxical nature of evolutionary innovations, where", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady says the team plans to keep excavating the site after the \"tantalizing\" find, which may be older than any other find predating the Clovis people once thought to be the first in North America, NBC News reports. University of Washington professor of archaeology Donald K. Grayson, however, predicts there will be a lot of skepticism about the find. \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he tells the AP. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" (Experts believe they have found evidence of a long-lost civilization in the Honduran rainforest.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1460}

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is being urged to set conservative catch limits and prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean ecosystem.\n\nThe decline of sardines is not a new phenomenon, as their populations have fluctuated widely in the past due to natural climate cycles and overfishing. However, the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a natural climate cycle, is believed to be a contributing factor, as it has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, which has repelled sardines.\n\nThe decline of sardines is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many predators, including brown pelicans, sea lions, and sharks, struggling to find food. Environmental groups are calling for a halt to sardine fishing until the population recovers, while scientists are working to understand the causes of the decline and how to mitigate its effects.\n\nIn related news, a recent assessment found that the sardine population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has also declined.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same.

The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The Clarion Nightsnake, also known as the Clarion Island Snake, was first spotted in 1936 by American naturalist William Beebe on the Revillagigedo Islands, off Mexico's Pacific coast. Despite subsequent searches, no further sightings were reported, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries.\n\nHowever, a team of researchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and the Mexican Institute of Ecology led by Daniel Mulcahy and Juan Martinez Gomez suspected that the snake might still exist. They timed their expedition in May to replicate Beebe's original steps and used his field notes as a guide. After weeks of searching, one of the researchers' graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, spotted one of the snakes, marking the first sighting since 1936.\n\nDNA analysis confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake is a distinct species, most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast, over 500 miles away. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey to the island on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also due to the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands are home to a small detachment of Mexican marines, and the island's ecosystem is vulnerable to external threats. The National Museum of Natural History has recognized the snake as a full species, and plans to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the island's delicate ecosystem.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity.

The patient's brother has also developed symptoms similar to Marburg, and 11 people who came into contact with the victim have tested negative for the virus. The Ugandan Ministry of Health has quarantined 80 people who had contact with the victim, including 60 health-care workers.\n\n**Symptoms and Transmission**\n\nMarburg virus has an incubation period of 5-10 days, and symptoms include fever, headache, myalgia, and hemorrhaging. The virus is not airborne and is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or animal. Fruit bats and their guano are believed to be the natural reservoir of the virus.\n\n**History of Outbreaks**\n\nMarburg virus was first identified in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia after laboratory workers handling African green monkeys imported from Uganda contracted the virus. Since then, there have been several outbreaks, including a large outbreak in 1998 that infected 154 people and killed 128, and another outbreak in 2004 that infected 252 people and killed 227.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Marburg, but hospitalized patients can receive general supportive therapy, including fluid replacement and blood transfusions. Experimental treatments are being developed, including a drug tested on lab monkeys infected with a deadly strain of Marburg.\n\n**Uganda's Response**\n\nThe Ugandan government has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The country's Prime Minister has stated that Uganda has experience and capacity to deal with the outbreak and that the World Health Organization has been informed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Marburg is a deadly virus, it is not particularly easy to catch, and if an outbreak is identified early and controlled, it is unlikely to escalate like the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

This gas giant is believed to be almost as big as Neptune and orbits the sun at a distance of billions of miles, taking 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete one orbit. The discovery was made by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006.\n\nThe team used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the gravitational effects of a massive, unseen planet on the orbits of small, icy bodies in the outer solar system. They believe that Planet Nine is a real planet, but it has not been directly observed yet. The researchers anticipate that it will be detected via telescope within the next five years.\n\nBrown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, have been searching for evidence of Planet Nine for years and have now published their findings in the Astronomical Journal. They are confident that the planet will be discovered and that it will be a significant addition to our understanding of the solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet, with some calling for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown and other scientists argue that Pluto is not a planet and that it is an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Pluto's status has led to a re-evaluation of the definition of a planet, with the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defining a planet as an object that has cleared its orbit of other objects.

In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4511}

The review comes after The Washington Post reported that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of innocent people, but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.\n\nThe review has found that nearly every examiner in the FBI's microscopic hair comparison unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia.

In response, women are turning to self-induced abortion methods, including the use of misoprostol, a medication that can induce a miscarriage. This trend is particularly concerning in states where abortion clinics are scarce or inaccessible, and where women may be forced to travel to other states or countries to access abortion services.\n\nAccording to a study, 2.2% of women in the US have attempted to self-induce an abortion, with a higher rate among women in Texas. The study also found that the number of women seeking to self-induce an abortion has increased in recent years, particularly among women who are low-income, uninsured, or living in rural areas.\n\nThe use of misoprostol for self-induced abortion is not a new phenomenon, but it has become more common in recent years due to the increasing unavailability of abortion services. Women are turning to the internet and online forums to find information and support, with many seeking to purchase misoprostol online or through illegal pharmacies.\n\nHowever, the use of misoprostol for self-induced abortion carries significant risks, including the potential for complications and the risk of arrest and prosecution. Women who attempt to self-induce an abortion may experience bleeding, infection, and other serious health complications, and may also face legal consequences if they are caught.\n\nIn response to the growing trend of self-induced abortion, some reproductive rights advocates are calling for greater access to safe and legal abortion services, including the use of telemedicine and online consultations. Others are advocating for the legalization of abortion in all states, and for greater support for women who are seeking to end their pregnancies.\n\nOverall, the trend of self-induced abortion in the US is a complex and controversial issue, with significant implications for women's health and reproductive rights.

The European finance ministers have warned that a \"no\" vote will lead to a tough future for Greece, with tough decisions needed to get the economy back on track.\n\nThe final hours of campaigning have seen rallies in Athens and other cities, with over 40,000 people gathering to show their support for the \"no\" or \"yes\" vote.

Conway's comments, which included telling viewers to \"go buy Ivanka's stuff,\" have been deemed a violation of federal ethics rules.

The problem? She might have violated federal ethics rules with the plug. Government workers aren't supposed to endorse products, and Conway not only did so, she wasn't shy about it: \"I'm going to give a free commercial here,\" she said. \"Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.” Per the Hill, this is the rule from the Office of Government Ethics she appears to have run afoul of: \"An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service, or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives.\" It's not clear whether the OGE will investigate, but someone who violates this rule can be suspended or even fired, though the person is likely to receive only a warning for a first offense, reports Politico. \"This is jaw-dropping to me,\" a former acting director of the office tells the Washington Post. It \"would seem to be a clear violation.\" President Trump, of course, has also addressed Nordstrom's move, tweeting, \"Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump's tweet \"was less about his family's business and an attack on his daughter,\" per CNNMoney.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

In 2013, Iranian hackers infiltrated a small New York dam, and in 2014, a hacker took control of a large utility's wind farm, changing a critical setting that could have damaged the generator and destabilized the grid.\n\nThe attacks are not isolated incidents. The Associated Press has found that sophisticated foreign hackers have been targeting the U.S. energy sector, including the power grid, for years. In 2012 and 2013, Russian hackers launched attacks on U.S. energy companies, and in 2014, Iranian hackers targeted the industry.\n\nThe attacks are often carried out by hackers who use malware to gain access to the grid's control systems. Once inside, they can manipulate the systems to shut down generating stations, foul communications networks, and cause blackouts. The hackers can also spread malware to other companies, making it difficult to trace the attacks back to their source.\n\nThe grid's vulnerability is due in part to the age of the equipment and the lack of security measures in place. Many of the control systems are decades old and were never designed to handle electronic threats. Additionally, the rush to tie smart meters and other smart appliances to the grid has created new vulnerabilities.\n\nUtilities are taking steps to improve their cybersecurity, but experts say it is a constant battle to stay ahead of the attackers. The Department of Homeland Security has helped some energy companies improve their defenses, but the agency's efforts are limited by its budget and the complexity of the problem.\n\nThe consequences of a successful attack could be catastrophic. A blackout caused by a cyberattack could last for months, affecting not just the power grid but also the economy and daily life. The grid's operators are working to prevent such an event, but experts say it is only a matter of time before a major attack occurs.\n\nThe Associated Press investigation found that the attacks are not limited to the power grid. Hackers have also targeted other critical infrastructure, including water and gas pipelines, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has warned that a coordinated attack on just nine critical power stations could cause a coast-to-coast blackout.\n\nThe investigation also found that the government's response to the attacks is limited by its budget and the complexity of the problem.

In fact, per a separate AP investigation, \"sophisticated foreign hackers\" have accessed about a dozen power networks here, attacks that the AP says the US public is rarely informed about. US infrastructure is often run by creaky systems that were previously offline, which kept them relatively safe. But, \"against the advice of hacking gurus,\" as the Journal notes, many companies started connecting their systems to the Internet without adequately securing them. And the number of such hacks has been creeping up since.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

This hemispheric specialization for sound processing is a unique feature of both human and bat brains, and has not been observed in any other animal species.\n\nThe study, published in Frontiers of Neuroscience, found that the left hemisphere of the bat brain is better at processing fast sounds, while the right hemisphere is better at processing slow sounds. This asymmetry is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females. The researchers believe that this unique feature of bat brains may hold the key to understanding certain human language disorders, such as aphasia.\n\nThe study's senior author, Stuart Washington, a neuroscientist at Georgetown, says that the findings have implications for the study of human language and speech recognition. He notes that the unique features of bat brains may provide a new avenue for understanding and improving computer speech recognition.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of behavioral and neurophysiological techniques to study the bat brains, and found that the bats use their left and right hemispheres to process different aspects of their communication sounds.

In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer.
