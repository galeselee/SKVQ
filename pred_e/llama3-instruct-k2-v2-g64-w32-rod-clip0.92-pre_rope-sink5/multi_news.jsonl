The dispute centers around the CIA's monitoring of Senate computers, which may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. The monitoring is believed to be related to the committee's 6,300-page report on the CIA's use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques.\n\nThe report, which took four years to complete and cost $40 million, is said to be a scathing indictment of the program, detailing how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the effectiveness of the techniques. The report also shows that the techniques did not provide the intelligence that led to the CIA's discovery of Osama bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan.\n\nSenator Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, has urged President Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report and to strip the CIA of control over what parts of the report are made public. Udall has also called for the CIA to be stripped of control over the report's declassification, citing the agency's history of obstruction and lack of transparency.\n\nThe CIA has disputed some of the report's findings and has refused to comment on the monitoring allegations. The agency has also characterized an internal review of the program as a compilation of summaries of classified documents, rather than an analytical report.\n\nThe dispute has heightened tensions between the CIA and the Senate Intelligence Committee, with some lawmakers calling for greater transparency and accountability.

However, this same mechanism also prevents the ice crystals from melting, even in above-freezing temperatures.\n\nResearchers have found that the ice crystals do not melt at their expected melting point, but instead persist inside the fish's bodies, even after temperatures rise above the freezing point. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has been observed in controlled laboratory settings, but this is the first time it has been found in nature.\n\nThe accumulation of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies could have adverse effects on their health, and it is unclear whether the fish have evolved mechanisms to deal with this issue. The highest concentration of ice crystals was found in the fish's spleens, which may be trying to filter out the ice crystals to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThis discovery highlights the complex and often unintended consequences of evolutionary innovations.

However, this same mechanism also prevents ice crystals from melting, even in above-freezing temperatures.\n\nResearchers found that ice crystals persist inside the fish's bodies, even after temperatures rise above the freezing point, a phenomenon known as \"superheating.\" This has been observed in controlled laboratory settings, but not in nature until now.\n\nThe accumulation of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies may have adverse effects on their health, and it is unclear whether the fish have evolved mechanisms to deal with this issue. The highest concentration of ice crystals was found in the fish's spleens, which may be trying to filter out the ice crystals to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is being urged to set conservative catch limits and prohibit unregulated fishing on other forage fish species to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean ecosystem.\n\nThe decline is not just a natural fluctuation, but rather a steep decline that has been ongoing for several years. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a natural climate cycle, is thought to be a contributing factor, as it has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, which has repelled sardines. However, the exact cause of the decline is still unclear, and scientists are working to understand the complex relationships between ocean conditions, fishing practices, and the sardine population.\n\nThe decline of sardines is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many predators, including brown pelicans, sea lions, and sharks, struggling to find food. Environmental groups are calling for a halt to sardine fishing until the population recovers, while others argue that a more nuanced approach is needed. The Pacific sardine fishery has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, with the species experiencing a collapse in the 1950s and a rebound in the 1980s.\n\nResearchers are working to understand the complex relationships between sardines, ocean conditions, and fishing practices, and are studying the impact of the decline on the ecosystem.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same.

The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

A record 20 million Americans collected unemployment benefits last year, leading to a shortage of funds in many states. As a result, 36 states have increased the annual tax businesses pay to finance unemployment benefits, with some states increasing taxes by as much as 124% or more.\n\nThe recession has emptied many state unemployment insurance trust funds, prompting states to borrow from the federal government or cut benefits for the unemployed.

In some states, unemployment compensation funds are still in the black, but reserves are rapidly dwindling.\n\nBusiness owners are facing increased taxes, with the average tax per employee increasing to $171 in Virginia, for example. This is expected to make it more expensive for employers to hire new workers, which could exacerbate the unemployment problem. Economists warn that these tax increases may actually contribute to joblessness, rather than stimulating the economy.\n\nIn addition to tax increases, some states are cutting benefits for the unemployed, including seniors who are receiving reduced benefits or having their benefits cut altogether. For example, in Virginia, seniors are seeing their monthly benefits cut by as much as a third, or about $190 per week.\n\nExperts argue that these measures undermine the fundamental goal of the unemployment insurance system, which is to boost the economy and help people in need during an economic downturn.

There is no specific treatment or cure for Marburg, but hospital patients receive general supportive therapy.\n\n**Outbreak in Uganda**\n\nThe current outbreak in Uganda has resulted in the death of one patient, with 99 contacts under quarantine. Testing has revealed that 11 people have tested negative for the virus, and those who still show symptoms will be re-tested after three days.

The virus has also been detected in Kenya, where a 15-year-old boy died of the disease in 1987.\n\n**Experimental Treatments**\n\nExperimental treatments for Marburg are being developed, including a drug tested on lab monkeys infected with a deadly strain of the virus. The drug, developed by Tekmira pharmaceutical, showed promising results in treating the animals.\n\n**Government Response**\n\nThe Ugandan government has experience in handling similar health threats, including Ebola outbreaks.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

This gas giant is believed to be almost as big as Neptune and orbits the sun at a distance of billions of miles, taking 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete one orbit. The discovery was made by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006.\n\nThe team used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the gravitational effects of a massive, unseen planet on the orbits of small, icy bodies in the outer solar system. They estimate that the new planet is 5-10 times more massive than Earth and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes it from 20 to 40 astronomical units (AU) from the sun.\n\nWhile the discovery has not been confirmed, the researchers believe that it will be detected via telescope within the next five years. Brown and his team are confident that the new planet will be a game-changer for our understanding of the solar system, and they expect it to be a major topic of discussion in the scientific community.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet, with some arguing that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown and other scientists believe that Pluto is not a planet and that it is an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Pluto's status has led to a re-evaluation of the definition of a planet, and the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has established a new definition that requires a planet to \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbit. According to this definition, Pluto does not meet the criteria for a planet, and it is now classified as a dwarf planet.\n\nDespite the controversy, Brown and his team are excited about the discovery of Planet Nine and the new insights it will provide into the solar system.

In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4511}

This discrepancy has sparked a debate among scientists, with some suggesting that the universe may contain unknown subatomic particles or that Einstein's theory of relativity is incomplete.\n\nThe discovery was made by refining the accuracy of distance measurements to galaxies using the Hubble Space Telescope. The team measured the brightness of stars in 19 galaxies and compared it to the brightness of supernovae, allowing them to calculate the distance to these galaxies. The new data has reduced the uncertainty in the Hubble constant to just 2.4%, making it the most accurate measurement to date.\n\nThe discrepancy between the new measurement and previous estimates has raised questions about the nature of dark energy and dark matter, which make up 95% of the universe. Some scientists suggest that the universe may contain unknown particles or that dark energy is more powerful than previously thought. Others propose that Einstein's theory of relativity is incomplete or that there is a problem with the way we measure the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the universe and its fate.

The review is the largest post-conviction review ever conducted by the FBI and will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since 1985. The review comes after The Washington Post reported that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of innocent people, but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.\n\nThe review has found that nearly every examiner in the FBI's microscopic hair comparison unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants.

His next film, \"Ready Player One\", is expected to be a major hit, and he has several other projects in the works.\n\nOverall, the poor performance of \"The BFG\" is a rare misstep for Spielberg, and it remains to be seen how the film will perform in the coming weeks.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten one-page summary of all the news:\n\nSteven Spielberg's \"The BFG\" has become a rare box office disappointment, earning only $22 million in its opening weekend in the United States.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The unmasked names were then disseminated to all those at the National Security Council, the Defense Department, and other top officials.\n\nRice's requests were made during the transition period, and it is unclear what specific information she sought or why. Her denials of any knowledge about the surveillance have been criticized, with some calling her statements \"lies.\" The story has also led to calls for Rice to testify under oath", "answers": ["Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is back in the news again, this time regarding President Trump's wiretapping allegations. On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4159}

The attacks are part of a growing trend of sophisticated cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, including the power grid, water and gas pipelines, and financial institutions.\n\nThe attacks are often carried out by nation-state actors, such as Iran and Russia, who are seeking to gain access to sensitive information and disrupt the flow of power. The hackers use a variety of tactics, including malware, phishing emails, and exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software and equipment.\n\nThe power grid is particularly vulnerable because much of the equipment is decades old and was never designed with security in mind. Many control systems are still run on outdated software, such as Windows '95 and FORTRAN, which lack modern malware protections. Additionally, the rush to tie smart meters and other smart appliances to the grid has created new vulnerabilities.\n\nUtilities are taking steps to improve their cybersecurity, including hiring cybersecurity experts and implementing new security measures.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

The report also concluded that the Patriots' equipment staff, led by John Jastremski and Jim McNally, were involved in the deflation of the balls.

The team has launched a website to present its side of the story, which includes a rebuttal to the Wells Report and a critique of the league's handling of the investigation.\n\nThe team's lawyer, Daniel L.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10507}

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system. Aran Khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in Harvard's Technology Science journal. \"From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app,\" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site. Khanna says his app was created using his own Messenger history, not data scraping. \"I didn't write the program to be malicious,\" he says.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

He said the ruling particularly \"boggles the mind\" in light of Obama's recent executive order on immigration. He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \"rushed to the exits\" at the thought of Obama's move. But while Scalia may have been incensed, seemingly every other quarter was declaring victory, or at least partial victory. For example: Jan Brewer called it a \"victory for the rule of law,\" and for the 10th Amendment, because \"the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented,\" meaning the provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other crimes. Joe Arpaio agreed. \"I think this is a good section that's been upheld,\" he said, though he lamented the loss of \"the authority to arrest illegal aliens just by being there illegally.\" President Obama said he was also \"pleased\" with the decision, which \"makes unmistakably clear (that) Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform,\" but said he was still \"concerned\" about the remaining provision, according to CNN. Mitt Romney's statement, meanwhile, was decidedly vague. \"Today's decision underscores the need for a president who will lead on this critical issue,\" he said. \"President Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration.\" He said every state has a duty and right to secure its borders, but offered no explicit opinion on the ruling itself."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8065}

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up.

The report also found that the pay of CEOs has been growing much faster than the pay of other high earners, with CEO compensation increasing by 979% over the past 40 years, compared to a 11.2% increase in the typical worker's compensation.\n\nThe report attributes the growth in CEO compensation to the stock-related components of their pay, such as stock awards and stock options. It notes that the pay of CEOs is often linked to the performance of their companies' stock prices, and that the growth in CEO compensation is not driven by their individual productivity or contributions to their companies.\n\nThe report also highlights the impact of the growth in CEO compensation on the broader economy. It notes that the growth in CEO pay has contributed to the growth of income inequality, with the top 1% of earners receiving a disproportionate share of the growth in income. It also notes that the growth in CEO pay has reduced the bargaining power of workers and has contributed to the stagnation of wages for most Americans.\n\nThe report concludes that the growth in CEO compensation is a result of economic rents, or concessions that CEOs can draw from the economy not by virtue of their contribution to their companies, but by virtue of their position. It argues that the growth in CEO compensation is not justified by their productivity or performance, and that it is contributing to the growth of income inequality and the stagnation of wages for most Americans.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the need for policymakers to address the growth in CEO compensation and to promote policies that benefit workers and the broader economy.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary:\n\nThe pay gap between CEOs and workers has reached an alarming level, with CEOs of the top 350 companies earning 312 times more than their workers on average.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

{"pred": "A recent study has found that older fathers are more likely to have \"geekier\" sons, who are brighter, more focused, and less concerned with social norms. The study, conducted by King's College London, analyzed data from 15,000 twins and found that the age of the father, but not the mother, was significantly associated with the Geek Index, a measure of geeky traits such as non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness.\n\nThe researchers found that sons of older fathers scored higher on the Geek Index, which was linked to better academic performance, particularly in STEM subjects. The study also found that the effect was strongest in boys, with daughters seeming to be immune to the influence of paternal age on geekiness.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Magdalena Janecka, suggested that the findings could be due to the fact that older men are more likely to delay starting a family, which allows them to pass on geeky traits to their children. However, she also cautioned that the study should not be used to influence individual families' decisions on parenthood.\n\nThe study's results are a departure from previous research, which has shown that older sperm is more prone to genetic errors and is associated with an increased risk of autism and schizophrenia. The researchers believe that the genetic traits inherited from older fathers may be influencing both geekiness and autism.\n\nThe study's findings have been met with excitement from some scientists, who suggest that the trend towards delayed parenthood could lead to a \"society of geniuses\" that can solve the world's problems.

And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older.
