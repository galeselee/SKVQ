This includes introducing girls to female role models, explaining the responsibilities and rewards of leadership, and providing opportunities for girls to interact with successful women.

The death was investigated, but no criminal charges were filed.\n\nThe victim's sister, Shaneice Luke, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the facility and the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities. In response, the state agency sent Luke a bill for $11.67 million, citing the total Medicaid assistance provided to Rose from 2002 to 2012. The agency claims it is following federal Medicaid obligations by seeking reimbursement, but critics argue that the bill is retaliation for Luke's lawsuit.\n\nAssemblyman Harvey Weisenberg called the bill \"an outrage\" and \"retaliation\" against Luke, who lost her brother due to alleged abuse.

In response, the state agency sent Luke a bill for $11.67 million, citing the total Medicaid assistance provided to Rose from 2002 to 2012.\n\nCritics argue that the bill is retaliation for Luke's lawsuit and that", "answers": ["Rasheen Rose died while being restrained at Fineson Developmental Center, a state institution in Queens, on August 6, 2012—a death that was ruled a homicide by the New York medical examiner, and into which the district attorney's investigation is still open.

Rose, who had severe autism and could not communicate verbally, \"was basically crushed to death,\" says Luke's lawyer. But now, New York officials are billing Luke for $11.67 million, the AP reports. The claim against Rose's estate cites his total Medicaid assistance over a period of 10 years, up until the day he died at age 33. Medicaid doesn't typically demand reimbursement, but an attorney who has worked with others who've received similar bills after suing the state says officials have recently begun this \"problematic\" practice. A spokesperson for the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, which runs Fineson, says officials are simply following federal Medicaid obligations so that they don't lose their Medicaid funding, but an assemblyman who advocates for people with disabilities calls it \"retaliation.\" Last year, Gov.

Hejduk purchased a Hatchimal for her daughter's birthday, but the toy did not hatch despite following the instructions.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Spin Master's failure to disclose the toy's defects was a violation of consumer law, unfair competition, and false advertising. The lawsuit seeks a recall of the defective toys, restitution with interest, and compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages.\n\nSpin Master has denied the allegations, stating that the company provided troubleshooting support and replacement products for those whose toys did not work as expected.

The ship, which ran aground on a reef near Haiti on December 24, 1492, was believed to be the largest ship in the expedition, about 117ft (36m) long. US marine archaeologist Barry Clifford had previously claimed to have found the wreck, but Unesco experts have concluded that the ship is from a much later period.\n\nThe Unesco team, led by Xavier Nieto Prieto, a former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, examined the wreck and concluded that the artefacts found at the site were from a ship from the late 17th or 18th century, not the 15th or 16th century. The team also found that the site was further away from shore than expected, and that a metal tube seen by Clifford during a previous expedition was no longer present.\n\nUnesco has now announced plans to search for the Santa Maria in a number of locations, including on land and the seabed. The organization has also suggested that the ship may be buried under sediment on what was once the seabed, but is now coastal marshland. However, some experts have criticized this plan, citing historical accounts that suggest the ship could not have reached the marshland due to shallow reefs.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a debate among scholars and has implications for the US's relationship with Unesco, which has been strained in recent years.
