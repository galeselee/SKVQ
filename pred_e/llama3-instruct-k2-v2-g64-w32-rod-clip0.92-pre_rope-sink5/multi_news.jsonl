{"pred": "**Youngest Person to Reach South Pole Solo: Scott Sears Completes Epic Trek**\n\nScott Sears, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, has become the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo, completing a 702-mile trek across the Antarctic plateau in just 38 days. Sears, brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray, arrived at the South Pole on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe journey was not without its challenges, with Sears facing 150mph winds and temperatures of -50c. He pulled a sled and supplies for five weeks, crossing crevasses and glaciers along the way. The first part of the journey, from Hercules Inlet, was particularly treacherous, with Sears not roped up to a teammate and using skis to cross the ice.\n\nSears' journey was marked by a series of setbacks, including hitting a wall with just 38km to go on Christmas Eve. However, he persevered, fueled by juice, biltong, chocolate, and music on his iPod. He eventually reached the pole, where he was \"absolutely chuffed to pieces\" and described the experience as \"overwhelming\".\n\nSears' achievement has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which were destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. He is expected to take a few weeks to process the experience, having spent nearly six weeks alone in a tent.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records has yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books. However, his achievement has already been recognized by Andy Murray's mother, Judy Murray, who congratulated him on Twitter.assistant\n\nHere is the one-page summary:\n\n**Youngest Person to Reach South Pole Solo: Scott Sears Completes Epic Trek**\n\nScott Sears, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, has become the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo, completing a 702-mile trek across the Antarctic plateau in just 38 days.assistant\n\nHere is the one-page summary:\n\n**Youngest Person to Reach South Pole Solo: Scott Sears Completes Epic Trek**\n\nScott Sears, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, has become the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo, completing a 702-mile trek across the Antarctic plateau in just 38 days.

Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.

Elliot, who was dressed in a white kitchen uniform, which is unknown how he obtained, escaped through a hole in the fencing system and made a three-and-a-half-mile trek to Ionia, where he carjacked a woman and stole her Jeep Liberty. The woman was held hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County, Indiana, before she escaped at a gas station by locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911.\n\nThe Indiana State Police and local authorities launched a manhunt for Elliot, who was described as armed and dangerous. A false identification was reported in Tennessee, but it was later determined to be incorrect. The police searched the community of Shipshewana, Indiana, and went door-to-door, but Elliot was not found. The search was suspended, and the police are now asking the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.\n\nElliot was arrested in LaPorte County, Indiana, on Monday evening after a short chase. He was wearing black pants, a white t-shirt, and a white beanie cap, and was described as polite and emotionless during his arrest. He is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Corrections Director, Dan Heyns, promised a thorough investigation into the escape and said that Elliot's ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing was likely due to the color of his uniform.
