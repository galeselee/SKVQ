This includes introducing girls to female role models, explaining the responsibilities and rewards of leadership, and providing opportunities for girls to interact with successful women.

The death was investigated, but no criminal charges were filed.\n\nThe victim's sister, Shaneice Luke, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the facility and the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities. In response, the state agency sent Luke a bill for $11.67 million, citing the total Medicaid assistance provided to Rose from 2002 to 2012. The agency claims it is following federal Medicaid obligations by seeking reimbursement, but critics argue that the bill is retaliation for Luke's lawsuit.\n\nAssemblyman Harvey Weisenberg called the bill \"an outrage\" and \"retaliation\" against Luke, who lost her brother due to alleged abuse.

The discovery highlights the complex and often paradoxical nature of evolutionary innovations, where", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady says the team plans to keep excavating the site after the \"tantalizing\" find, which may be older than any other find predating the Clovis people once thought to be the first in North America, NBC News reports. University of Washington professor of archaeology Donald K. Grayson, however, predicts there will be a lot of skepticism about the find. \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he tells the AP. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" (Experts believe they have found evidence of a long-lost civilization in the Honduran rainforest.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1460}

According to a Health Ministry document, the cost of a packet of cigarettes could rise to $100 by 2020, with a 30% increase in price every year after that. This would make cigarettes one of the most expensive in the world.\n\nThe proposal is part of a broader strategy to reduce smoking prevalence in New Zealand, which currently stands at around 18%. The government aims to reduce this number to zero by 2025, and is considering a range of measures to achieve this goal.\n\nOne of the key measures being considered is a significant increase in the cost of cigarettes. The document suggests that a shock increase of 30% to 60% could be followed by smaller increases of 10% per year, reaching a price of $100 per packet by 2025. This would be achieved through a combination of annual price increases and a ban on tobacco sales in cars with children.\n\nOther measures being considered include regulating tobacco as a highly toxic substance, banning smoking in cars with children, doubling anti-smoking media campaigns, and removing tobacco from duty-free sale.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that this approach will be effective. Felix, a smoker who struggles to quit, believes that people will simply turn to the black market to get their fix. \"People still use heroin, cocaine is expensive. So I don't think people will stop smoking,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister, John Key, has also expressed concerns about the potential for a black market to emerge, saying that the government needs to consider the sustainability of such a measure.\n\nThe Health Ministry has released a document outlining the proposed measures, but has stressed that it is an internal policy discussion paper and does not represent government policy. The government is expected to make a decision on the best approach to take in the coming months.assistant\n\nHere is the one-page summary:\n\n**New Zealand Considers Drastic Measures to Make Country Smoke-Free by 2025**\n\nThe New Zealand government is considering drastic measures to make the country smoke-free by 2025, including a massive hike in the cost of cigarettes.

The boy, who had been diagnosed with autism, was kept hidden in the closet for three years, sedated with liquid sleep medication to keep him quiet. His mother, Veronica Aguilar, 39, had been hiding him from the family, including his stepfather, Jose Pinzon, who lived in the home, and even authorities.\n\nAccording to court documents, Yonatan's mother had convinced teachers, counselors, coaches, medical staff, and social workers that her son was safe in her home, despite reports of possible child abuse. The family had been under investigation six times between 2009 and 2012, but no formal case was opened. In 2012, Yonatan's mother told authorities that he had gone to live in an institution in Mexico, but in reality, he was being kept in the closet.\n\nYonatan's body was found on August 22, 2016, by his stepfather, who was led to the closet by his mother. The boy weighed only 34 pounds and was covered in pressure sores from the tile floor. His mother is now charged with murder and child abuse causing death and is being held on $2 million bail.\n\nThe case has raised questions about how Yonatan's mother was able to keep him hidden for so long, and how authorities failed to intervene despite multiple reports of possible abuse. The Department of Children and Family Services has launched an investigation into the case, and officials are working to determine how to prevent similar tragedies in the future.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten one-page summary:\n\n**Tragic Discovery: 11-Year-Old Boy Found Dead in Closet, Hidden from Family and Authorities**\n\nIn a shocking and disturbing case, an 11-year-old boy, Yonatan Daniel Aguilar, was found dead in a closet in his family's home in Echo Park, Los Angeles.
