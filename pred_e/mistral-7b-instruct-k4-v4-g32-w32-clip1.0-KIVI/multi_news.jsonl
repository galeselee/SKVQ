Sears completed a 702-mile trek through harsh Antarctic conditions, including 150mph winds and temperatures as low as -50°C, in 38 days. His journey ended on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books. The trek was particularly challenging due to the dangerous crevasses in the initial part of the journey from Hercules Inlet, where sea ice meets land in Antarctica. Sears, who is from east London, had to travel alone, which meant he was not roped up to a teammate who could stop him from falling into crevasses. Instead, he used skis to cross the ice.\n\nSears faced a significant challenge in the final stages of his journey, describing in a blog post that he hit a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve, his penultimate day. He overcame this by taking a break, eating some snacks, and listening to music on his iPod. On Christmas Day, he reached the South Pole in blue skies and was \"absolutely chuffed to pieces.\"\n\nSears has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. His mother-in-law, Judy Murray, congratulated him on Twitter. Sears is expected to take a few weeks to fully process his achievement, as he has been alone in a tent for nearly six weeks. He is looking forward to having a shower and eating food.\n\nThe news of Sears' achievement was reported by various media outlets, emphasizing his record-breaking solo trek and his charitable efforts.

He was also a significant philanthropist, particularly in African-American education and culture.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on African-American communities in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of over 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him.

Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest.
