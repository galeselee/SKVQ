Sears completed a 702-mile trek through harsh Antarctic conditions, including 150mph winds and temperatures as low as -50°C, in 38 days. His journey ended on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books. The trek was particularly challenging due to the dangerous crevasses in the initial part of the journey from Hercules Inlet, where sea ice meets land in Antarctica. Sears, who is from east London, had to travel alone, which meant he was not roped up to a teammate who could stop him from falling into crevasses. Instead, he used skis to cross the ice.\n\nSears faced a significant challenge in the final stages of his journey, describing in a blog post that he hit a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve, his penultimate day. He overcame this by taking a break, eating some snacks, and listening to music on his iPod. On Christmas Day, he reached the South Pole in blue skies and was \"absolutely chuffed to pieces.\"\n\nSears has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. His mother-in-law, Judy Murray, congratulated him on Twitter. Sears is expected to take a few weeks to fully process his achievement, as he has been alone in a tent for nearly six weeks. He is looking forward to having a shower and eating food.\n\nThe news of Sears' achievement was reported by various media outlets, emphasizing his record-breaking solo trek and his charitable efforts.

He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of over 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's body, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, a phenomenon known as superheating. This superheated ice can persist inside the fish for extended periods, even during summer warming episodes, as the temperatures in Antarctic waters rarely exceed the melting point of the ice.\n\nThe discovery of this superheating effect challenges the conventional understanding of AFPs, which were previously thought to primarily protect the fish from freezing. The researchers found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This mechanism, while beneficial for preventing freezing, also poses a potential risk, as the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's body could cause damage over time.\n\nThe study raises questions about the long-term costs and consequences of the AFPs, as the fish may need to evolve other mechanisms to deal with the accumulated ice crystals. The highest concentration of ice crystals was found in the fish's spleen, suggesting that this organ may play a role in filtering the ice crystals out of the blood.\n\nThe findings provide insights into the complexities of evolution and the trade-offs that come with adaptive traits.

You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has declined dramatically, with the November 2013 estimate of 378,000 tons being the lowest in more than a decade and far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline is causing concern among scientists and environmental groups, who fear that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if sardines do not recover soon.\n\nThe reasons for the decline are unclear, but one factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The latest decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. Scientists are debating whether the decline is due to ocean conditions or overfishing.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is causing concern for the health of the marine ecosystem, as many predators are relying on them for food. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013.\n\nFor further information and to voice concerns, individuals are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish and write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The study suggests that social pressures and a rapid transition to the diet may contribute to lapses, with many former vegetarians/vegans reporting difficulties in maintaining a \"pure diet\" and feeling uncomfortable standing out due to their dietary choices. Current vegetarians/vegans, on the other hand, have diverse motivations for maintaining their diet, which may indicate that more diverse messaging and outreach could be beneficial.\n\nIn the second news passage, a personal account is shared about a man's decision to stop eating meat in 1995. His reasons for becoming a vegetarian were not related to any specific event or campaign but rather a combination of personal circumstances and a dislike for his job. He found it challenging to maintain a vegetarian diet, particularly due to his dislike of vegetables and the limited options available to him.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. are unnecessary, amounting to about 47 million prescriptions annually. These prescriptions are primarily for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses. The majority of these prescriptions are for acute respiratory conditions, with half of them being unnecessary.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts have identified this overuse of antibiotics as a major contributor to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs. These superbugs pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide.\n\nThe studies suggest that better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing. Simple steps, such as displaying posters in patient waiting rooms, can also help reduce antibiotic prescribing.\n\nThe White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15%, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.\n\nThe CDC has published a comprehensive analysis outlining the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., titled Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar systems produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm). West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity needs during peak demand by 65%, compared to the 54% reduction achieved by south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels may be more effective due to homeowners' lifestyles, as they capture solar energy late in the afternoon, a time when electricity usage and demand surge. Additionally, less electricity generated by west-facing panels would be wasted and sent back to the grid, making it easier for utility companies to manage.\n\nThe study has the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, particularly for homeowners with east-west roof pitches who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar. The research also suggests that homeowners may be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during summer months, and the overall outcome during winter months remains uncertain. The study's findings are not universally accepted, as some utility companies still adhere to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb and refuse to offer rebates for west-facing panels.\n\nThe study adds to previous research showing that west-facing solar systems may be more effective at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones. However, the benefits of tinkering with solar panel orientation vary depending on the region, and the structure of incentives provided by utility companies also plays a role in how consumers choose to orient their panels.\n\nIn conclusion, the Pecan Street study raises questions about the conventional wisdom of facing solar panels south and suggests that west-facing panels may be more effective, particularly during peak demand hours.

The extinction of the Javan rhino in Vietnam, confirmed by WWF, is a tragic indicator of the decline of biodiversity in the region.\n\nThe Mekong region is home to some of earth's most endangered species, such as tigers, Asian elephants, Mekong dolphins, and Mekong giant catfish. The WWF has warned that the region's valuable natural assets and species will continue to disappear without accelerated efforts to green the region's economies.\n\nThe six leaders from the Greater Mekong Sub-region are meeting in Myanmar from December 19-20, and WWF is calling upon them to prioritize the benefits of biodiversity and the costs of losing it in their decision-making and regional cooperation.\n\nThe Mekong region, part of the Golden Triangle infamous for drug trafficking, is extremely fragile and is losing biodiversity at a tragic rate. Conservationists are urging regional governments to recognize that protecting biodiversity is an investment for long-term sustainability, especially in the face of global environmental change.\n\nThe report also mentioned that the Huffington Post reported on these findings, describing the region as threatened by habitat loss, deforestation, climate change, and overdevelopment.

His retirement was honored with a special hour-long tribute on 60 Minutes, which he watched in his home.\n\nSafer's career spanned over five decades, during which he produced more than 900 stories. His work included groundbreaking reports such as the 1965 CBS News report from Cam Ne, Vietnam, showing U.S. Marines burning villagers' huts, and a 60 Minutes story on Lenell Geter, a black man wrongly accused of armed robbery and later exonerated due to Safer's report.\n\nSafer's stories were known for their originality, quality, and unique storytelling. He had a knack for linking words and images, making his stories both visually and audibly engaging. Safer was also known for his ability to find the absurd in everyday situations and for his sense of humor, which he used to entertain viewers.\n\nIn addition to his journalistic work, Safer was an amateur artist and enjoyed ridiculing pretentiousness in the art world.

Coronel Aispuro, a former beauty queen who was born in California and holds dual citizenship, met El Chapo in 2006 when she was 17 and they married in 2007. She questioned the conditions her husband is living in at the Antiplano prison, claiming the Mexican government is responsible for El Chapo's health.

She expressed concern about the impact his criminal activities might have on her daughters and the potential judgment they might face in the future. Coronel Aispuro also spoke about her husband's desire to collaborate on a film about his life to counter untruths and sensationalism. The Mexican actress Kate del Castillo was exploring such a film project after Guzman reached out to her.
