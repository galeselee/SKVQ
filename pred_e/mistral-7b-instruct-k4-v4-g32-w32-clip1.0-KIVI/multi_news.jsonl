Sears completed a 702-mile trek through harsh Antarctic conditions, including 150mph winds and temperatures as low as -50°C, in 38 days. His journey ended on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books. The trek was particularly challenging due to the dangerous crevasses in the initial part of the journey from Hercules Inlet, where sea ice meets land in Antarctica. Sears, who is from east London, had to travel alone, which meant he was not roped up to a teammate who could stop him from falling into crevasses. Instead, he used skis to cross the ice.\n\nSears faced a significant challenge in the final stages of his journey, describing in a blog post that he hit a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve, his penultimate day. He overcame this by taking a break, eating some snacks, and listening to music on his iPod. On Christmas Day, he reached the South Pole in blue skies and was \"absolutely chuffed to pieces.\"\n\nSears has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. His mother-in-law, Judy Murray, congratulated him on Twitter. Sears is expected to take a few weeks to fully process his achievement, as he has been alone in a tent for nearly six weeks. He is looking forward to having a shower and eating food.\n\nThe news of Sears' achievement was reported by various media outlets, emphasizing his record-breaking solo trek and his charitable efforts.

Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas described the speech as \"different.\"\n\nInitially, Perry's spokesman declined to comment on the matter, but later offered a statement, saying, \"The Governor is passionate about the issues he talks about.\" It's important to note that the videos do not provide definitive evidence of Perry being intoxicated, and the candidate's campaign has not officially addressed this specific allegation.\n\nThis incident has sparked widespread discussion and speculation, with some questioning Perry's fitness for the presidency based on his speech delivery.

{"pred": "The news articles highlight the life and philanthropic work of Julius Rosenwald, a Jewish American businessman and the son of German immigrants. Rosenwald, known as \"JR,\" started his career as a men's clothing salesperson and later partnered with Richard Sears, co-founder of Sears, Roebuck and Co., transforming it into the largest mail-order firm in the world. He was also a significant philanthropist, particularly in African-American education and culture.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on African-American communities in the early 1900s. He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of over 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him. These schools played a crucial role in the education of thousands of African-American children, including civil rights activist John Lewis and poet Maya Angelou.\n\nA new documentary, \"Rosenwald,\" tells the story of his little-known contributions to African-American culture and education. The film, directed by Aviva Kempner, was screened at the NAACP national convention in Philadelphia, where it was well-received. Kempner's documentary celebrates the cooperation between Rosenwald and the African-American community, highlighting the Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, or repairing the world.\n\nThe documentary also sheds light on Rosenwald's personal life and influences. He was heavily influenced by his rabbi, Emil Hirsch, and was moved by the parallels he drew between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America. He was also inspired by the writings of Booker T. Washington, a prominent black leader at the time, and became a funder of Washington's Tuskegee University in Alabama.\n\nRosenwald's philanthropy extended beyond education, as he also supported promising black artists, helping many of them catapult onto the national stage. His philanthropic efforts made the Rosenwald Fund the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century.\n\nThe documentary serves as a reminder of Rosenwald's significant impact on American history and encourages viewers", "answers": ["Julius Rosenwald is well known as the 20th-century American businessman who co-founded what we now call Sears. But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says.

{"pred": "In the news, there are four separate stories. The first story is about the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, a British soldier, in London. Two suspects, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, have been arrested and are known to have been under surveillance by MI5, the UK's security service. The government is facing criticism for missing signs that could have prevented the attack, but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has defended the security services, stating that it is impossible to control everyone in a free society. Drummer Rigby, 25, was a drummer in the army and had served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus. The investigation into the attack is ongoing, and a Commons inquiry has been announced.\n\nThe second story is about the brutal attack on the first police officers to arrive at the scene of the Woolwich beheading. The attackers lured the police to the scene and then ambushed them, with one of the suspects charging at the police car with a knife. The police opened fire, shooting both suspects, who remain under armed guard in separate London hospitals in stable conditions. The attack has shocked Londoners and revived the debate over how to confront extremism in Britain.\n\nThe third story is about the arrest of two more people by UK police in connection with the killing of Lee Rigby. The two suspects, a 29-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, were arrested on suspicion of conspiring to murder. Police have also searched six residential addresses across London and in Lincolnshire, England. None of the four suspects have been charged.\n\nThe fourth story is about Alexa Internet donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

Other developments include: Police also haven't identified any of the suspects, but Adebolajo's name was widely reported yesterday, and today the Telegraph has identified the other alleged knife-man as the confusingly similarly named Michael Adebowale, 22. Neighbors identified Adebowale after police armed with submachine guns raided his flat yesterday, emerging with two children, a baby, and two large envelopes. Adebowale was apparently known for distributing radical Islamist leaflets, and his girlfriend had recently converted to Islam. \"When you walked past, you would hear them singing Muslim songs,\" one neighbor says, adding that she \"saw the man who was in the video go inside the house. I think he was a boyfriend.\" Rigby, \"was due to come up this weekend,\" his wife tells the Guardian. \"You don't expect it to happen when he's in the UK.
