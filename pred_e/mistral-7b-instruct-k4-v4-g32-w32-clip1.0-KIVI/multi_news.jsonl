Sears completed a 702-mile trek through harsh Antarctic conditions, including 150mph winds and temperatures as low as -50°C, in 38 days. His journey ended on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books. The trek was particularly challenging due to the dangerous crevasses in the initial part of the journey from Hercules Inlet, where sea ice meets land in Antarctica. Sears, who is from east London, had to travel alone, which meant he was not roped up to a teammate who could stop him from falling into crevasses. Instead, he used skis to cross the ice.\n\nSears faced a significant challenge in the final stages of his journey, describing in a blog post that he hit a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve, his penultimate day. He overcame this by taking a break, eating some snacks, and listening to music on his iPod. On Christmas Day, he reached the South Pole in blue skies and was \"absolutely chuffed to pieces.\"\n\nSears has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. His mother-in-law, Judy Murray, congratulated him on Twitter. Sears is expected to take a few weeks to fully process his achievement, as he has been alone in a tent for nearly six weeks. He is looking forward to having a shower and eating food.\n\nThe news of Sears' achievement was reported by various media outlets, emphasizing his record-breaking solo trek and his charitable efforts.

He provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country, developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for migrants from the Jim Crow South, and funded the building of over 5,300 schools in the rural South, many of which were named after him.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes, which have developed antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to survive in frigid waters. These AFPs prevent the growth of ice crystals in the fish's body, but they also inhibit the melting of ice, a phenomenon known as superheating. This superheated ice can persist inside the fish for extended periods, even during summer warming episodes, as the temperatures in Antarctic waters rarely exceed the melting point of the ice.\n\nThe discovery of this superheating effect challenges the conventional understanding of AFPs, which were previously thought to primarily protect the fish from freezing. The researchers found that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for the ice to grow or melt. This mechanism, while beneficial for preventing freezing, also poses a potential risk, as the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's body could cause damage over time.\n\nThe study raises questions about the long-term costs and consequences of the AFPs, as the fish may need to evolve other mechanisms to deal with the accumulated ice crystals. The highest concentration of ice crystals was found in the fish's spleen, suggesting that this organ may play a role in filtering the ice crystals out of the blood.\n\nThe findings provide insights into the complexities of evolution and the trade-offs that come with adaptive traits.

You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": "The West Coast marine ecosystem is facing a significant threat due to the severe decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that serves as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the ecosystem by setting conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe sardine population has declined dramatically, with the November 2013 estimate of 378,000 tons being the lowest in more than a decade and far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline is causing concern among scientists and environmental groups, who fear that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if sardines do not recover soon.\n\nThe reasons for the decline are unclear, but one factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust cycles, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The latest decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. Scientists are debating whether the decline is due to ocean conditions or overfishing.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is causing concern for the health of the marine ecosystem, as many predators are relying on them for food. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013.\n\nFor further information and to voice concerns, individuals are encouraged to visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish and write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The study suggests that social pressures and a rapid transition to the diet may contribute to lapses, with many former vegetarians/vegans reporting difficulties in maintaining a \"pure diet\" and feeling uncomfortable standing out due to their dietary choices. Current vegetarians/vegans, on the other hand, have diverse motivations for maintaining their diet, which may indicate that more diverse messaging and outreach could be beneficial.\n\nIn the second news passage, a personal account is shared about a man's decision to stop eating meat in 1995. His reasons for becoming a vegetarian were not related to any specific event or campaign but rather a combination of personal circumstances and a dislike for his job. He found it challenging to maintain a vegetarian diet, particularly due to his dislike of vegetables and the limited options available to him.

The articles are based on studies and reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe studies found that approximately 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. are unnecessary, amounting to about 47 million prescriptions annually. These prescriptions are primarily for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses. The majority of these prescriptions are for acute respiratory conditions, with half of them being unnecessary.\n\nThe CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts have identified this overuse of antibiotics as a major contributor to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs. These superbugs pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide.\n\nThe studies suggest that better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing. Simple steps, such as displaying posters in patient waiting rooms, can also help reduce antibiotic prescribing.\n\nThe White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15%, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.\n\nThe CDC has published a comprehensive analysis outlining the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., titled Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar systems produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm). West-facing panels reduced homeowners' electricity needs during peak demand by 65%, compared to the 54% reduction achieved by south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels may be more effective due to homeowners' lifestyles, as they capture solar energy late in the afternoon, a time when electricity usage and demand surge. Additionally, less electricity generated by west-facing panels would be wasted and sent back to the grid, making it easier for utility companies to manage.\n\nThe study has the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, particularly for homeowners with east-west roof pitches who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar. The research also suggests that homeowners may be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during summer months, and the overall outcome during winter months remains uncertain. The study's findings are not universally accepted, as some utility companies still adhere to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb and refuse to offer rebates for west-facing panels.\n\nThe study adds to previous research showing that west-facing solar systems may be more effective at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones. However, the benefits of tinkering with solar panel orientation vary depending on the region, and the structure of incentives provided by utility companies also plays a role in how consumers choose to orient their panels.\n\nIn conclusion, the Pecan Street study raises questions about the conventional wisdom of facing solar panels south and suggests that west-facing panels may be more effective, particularly during peak demand hours.

President Obama signed a directive last year that calls for government cyber tools to be integrated with other national security tools. The directive was not made public until a report by The Guardian, but a declassified summary was released in January. The directive authorizes the use of offensive cyber attacks in foreign nations without their government's consent, as well as the establishment of a target list for such operations.\n\nThe meeting between Obama and Xi was significant as both leaders had not yet had detailed talks on cybersecurity, one of the most contentious bilateral issues. The leaders made broad commitments to work together on cybersecurity and improve military-to-military relations. The two leaders also discussed North Korea's nuclear threats and China's maritime disputes in Asia.\n\nThe Sunnylands estate, where the meeting took place, was built by Leonore and Walter Annenberg and was intended to be a retreat for American presidents.

The study found that for approximately 20% of patients, or 40,000 women annually in the United States, the removal of cancerous nodes does not improve survival, reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence, or change the treatment plan. This procedure, which has been performed for over a century, can cause complications such as infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling in the arm.\n\nThe study included 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. After the initial node biopsy, the patients were randomly assigned to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. The results showed that both groups had similar survival rates, with over 90% surviving at least five years, and recurrence rates in the armpit were less than 1%.\n\nThe study's findings are part of a trend towards less radical surgery for breast cancer, as research has found that breast cancer can spread early, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery. The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors and use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places. However, doctors have continued to believe that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be removed to improve survival.\n\nThe study's authors, including Dr. Monica Morrow of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, suggest that the findings should change medical practice for many patients.

During the 19th century, there were concerns about being buried alive, leading to the invention of elaborate contraptions to prevent such incidents. Some of these included air shafts, coffins with alarms, and grave designs that allowed the body to be watched for signs of life.\n\n3. Leland M.

Eva Cuypers and her team at the University of Leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds—called esters—were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports. The esters create a \"singular chemical cocktail\" in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells, including other dead animals, Science reports. Cuypers and her team published their findings last week. They believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job.

{"pred": "In the news, there are three main stories about Antarctica's rapidly increasing ice melt and its impact on global sea levels.\n\n1. Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost annually since 2012, according to a study published in the journal Nature. This represents a three-fold increase since the last assessment in 2012 and is causing global sea levels to rise by 0.6mm annually. The losses are primarily occurring in the West of Antarctica, where warm waters are melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean.\n\n2. A separate study, also published in Nature, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that as the ice melts, the bedrock may lift up, a process known as isostatic readjustment. However, this process may not be able to counterbalance the ice losses in the West and on the Antarctic Peninsula, as ocean warming is expected to continue to make the ice too thin for this process to help.\n\n3. A third story reports on a new study that found that Antarctica has shed some 2.7 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, corresponding to an increase in global sea level of more than 7.5mm. This makes Antarctica one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise, surpassing Greenland as the dominant contributor. The study was conducted by an international team of ice experts and used data from 24 independent satellite assessments over the past three decades.\n\nThese studies highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctic ice melt as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal communities. The researchers stress that the losses in Antarctica are a clear sign of climate change and that the forces driving these changes are not expected to improve in a warming climate.", "answers": ["Scientists monitoring ice loss in Antarctica have chilling news: The melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year, according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal Nature.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The stone, which is dark brown with lighter swirls, is part of the third volume of the Joseph Smith Papers, which also contains the printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon. The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during the Mormon pioneers' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. The stone will remain in the vault, but the pictures have been published to allow people who prefer visuals to words to better understand the religion's roots.\n\nThe Book of Mormon was translated from the gold plates that Smith found in upstate New York in 1827. The translation process involved the use of physical instruments, including the Urim and Thummim, a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim, and a seer stone, a small oval stone that Smith discovered before finding the gold plates. The translation was done by dictation, with Joseph Smith's wife Emma and several scribes, including Oliver Cowdery, assisting him. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, which still survives, supports the claim that the translation was done from another language in a short period of time.\n\nThe Book of Mormon was first made available for public purchase on March 26, 1830, and has since been translated into over 110 different languages. The translation process was a \"series of miraculous events\" that took place over a short period of time, with Joseph Smith testifying that it was \"by the gift and power of God\" that he was able to complete the translation.

The overcrowding and unstable weather and geography have been highlighted as significant factors contributing to the high death toll. The article mentions the cancellation of an expedition by Himalayan Experience (Himex), one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, instability in the Khumbu Icefall, and a massive serac threatening climbers. The growing number of climbers on Everest, most of them amateurs, and the increasing instability of the high-alpine environment, have raised concerns about managing the mountain's burgeoning popularity and deteriorating conditions.\n\nSecondly, a separate article discusses the risks Sherpas face while helping paying clients ascend Everest. The fatality rate of ethnic Sherpas working on Everest has been compared to traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation, and military combat. According to the data, the death rate for climbing Sherpas on Everest from 2004 to 2014 was twelve times higher than the death rate for U.S. military personnel deployed in Iraq from 2003-07. The article highlights the dangerous work Sherpas perform, including carrying loads, installing ladders, and stringing ropes, which requires them to spend more time on the most dangerous parts of the mountain, particularly in the Khumbu Icefall. The Sherpas' lower pay and lack of access to resources like bottled oxygen and dexamethasone contribute to their increased risk.\n\nIn response to the recent avalanche tragedy, Sherpas have announced a strike, demanding increased compensation for families of the deceased, better insurance benefits, and a permanent relief fund for injured Sherpas, among other demands. The collective anger and resentment expressed by the Sherpas over the past few days are unprecedented, and it remains to be seen whether the Nepali government will meet their demands.\n\nOverall, these news stories underscore the risks and challenges associated with climbing Mount Everest, particularly for Sherpas who face significantly higher death rates than other professions.", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The situation is so severe that it has been rated at least as bad as the Three Mile Island incident in 1979, and Japan has raised the severity rating to level 5 on the INES international scale.\n\nEngineers are working tirelessly to prevent a catastrophic radiation release by restoring power to the plant's cooling systems. They are laying additional cabling and attempting to connect an external transmission line to the plant. If successful, this would allow them to restart the water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods. Experts believe that this would be a significant step forward in establishing stability at the plant.\n\nHowever, the situation remains critical, and if the cooling infrastructure is not successfully restored, there is a last resort option to bury the plant in sand and concrete to prevent a radiation release. This method was used to seal leakages from the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nIn addition to the nuclear crisis, the earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread devastation, with nearly 7,000 people confirmed dead, over 10,000 missing, and hundreds of thousands homeless. Many of the homeless are battling near-freezing temperatures in shelters in northeastern coastal areas. Food, water, medicine, and heating fuel are in short supply.\n\nThe nuclear crisis has also had international implications, with low levels of radiation detected well beyond Tokyo. The United States has recommended a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken. The U.S. government has also offered Japan any help it can provide, and President Obama has asked for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety.\n\nDespite the challenges, the Japanese people remain resilient, with many praising the efforts of the 279 nuclear plant workers who are toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles, and protective suits.

{"pred": "Astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin from Caltech have provided evidence suggesting the existence of a ninth planet in our solar system, which they have named Planet Nine. The planet is estimated to be five to ten times the mass of Earth and is located far beyond the orbit of Pluto. However, it has not been observed directly, and its existence has been inferred from the motion of smaller objects in the outer solar system. The researchers believe that Planet Nine might have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn.\n\nIf confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto, which was the iconic ninth planet for three-quarters of a century, was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to Brown's observations. Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" has been working on finding a new planet to make amends with Pluto fans, especially his daughter, who was upset about Pluto's demotion.\n\nNASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has expressed excitement about the new research but cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system. Green emphasized the need for extraordinary evidence to support extraordinary claims.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object. If it exists, Planet Nine would be the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, but its extreme distance would make it difficult to detect due to its minimal reflection of sunlight.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would likely be met with controversy, as some argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown insists that Pluto is not a planet and that it is more interesting to explore the new type of object in the outer solar system. He believes that the controversy will gradually die down as people become more accustomed to the idea of a solar system with eight dominant objects.\n\nIn addition to the news about Planet Nine, there have been other significant developments in the field of astronomy. For example, NASA's New Horizons probe has revealed that Pluto has an atmosphere, weather, and a dynamically reworked surface", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd. While the dwarf planet tries to fight its way back into the good graces of Those Who Deem What Counts as a Planet, another icy orb even further out may snatch that designation first.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

{"pred": "The news summarized below provides updates on the ongoing civil war in Syria, focusing on its impact on various aspects of Syrian society, including the city of Damascus, the Alawite minority, and the country's economy.\n\n1. Damascus: The city, once known for its vibrant nightlife and all-night party scene, is now experiencing a significant transformation due to the war. Traffic is frequently disrupted, and people are wary of venturing out after dark due to increased kidnappings, shelling, and machine-gun fire. Basic necessities such as gasoline, food, and heating oil are becoming increasingly scarce, causing concern among residents as winter approaches. The city's infrastructure is also being affected, with streets being closed at a moment's notice and traffic diverted or bridges shut down.\n\n2. Alawite minority: Tensions are rising within Syria's Alawite minority, which has traditionally supported President Bashar al-Assad. Whispers of intrigue and strains within the Assad clan suggest that the pressures of the 19-month-old revolt are taking a toll on the cohesion of the Alawites. While there is no indication that Alawites are switching sides, many are expressing dissatisfaction with the regime and fear for their future in a post-Assad Syria.\n\n3. Economy: The ongoing conflict is taking a heavy toll on Syria's economy, with inflation rising to at least 36 percent and the currency dropping around 50 percent. Fuel shortages have become widespread, and many businesses are struggling to operate due to distribution problems, road closures, and the impact of international sanctions. Wealthy Syrians, who have traditionally supported the regime, are seeing their businesses pummeled by the conflict, with factories being burned down or damaged in fighting. Some warn that their companies are in danger of going under, worsening the country's buckling economy.\n\n4. Oil and gas pipelines: Syrian activists claim that government airstrikes on rebel areas in the country's north have killed at least 20 people and leveled buildings. Meanwhile, Syria's state news agency reports that rebels have blown up two oil and gas pipelines in the northeast near the Iraqi border. The pipelines were hit Thursday near the city of Deir", "answers": ["This could change things: Some Syrian rebels now have antiaircraft missiles, rebels and regional officials say. Video footage appears to show the rebels using such weapons, which have been smuggled into the country, the Wall Street Journal reports. Rebels say they downed a military helicopter yesterday, one of at least four aircraft reportedly shot down this week—if true, that's a quicker pace since the summer, although it's not clear how the copters and jets were brought down. Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the US, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-Western militias. More from Syria: The rebels today blew up one oil pipeline and one gas pipeline near Deir al-Zour, the AP reports, citing state media. Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions. Yet more trouble for Assad: Even his own sect, the Alawite minority, is growing discontent, the Washington Post reports. Alawites had been strong backers of Assad, as the Sunni majority backed the rebellion, because they feared losing power to Sunni Islamists. But, though there is no indication that Alawites plan to join the rebellion, there are reports of rifts even within Assad's own extended family."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4659}
{"pred": "NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is set to perform a historic flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, marking the end of the US space agency's bid to explore every planet in the solar system. The spacecraft, launched in 2006, has traveled 3 billion miles and will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto's surface at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT). The mission could provide valuable insights about Earth's history, including how it formed, where Earth's water came from, how life began on Earth, Earth's atmospheric structure, and how the sun affects Earth.\n\nPluto, a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, is expected to reveal a wealth of information about the solar system's early history. It is believed that Pluto and other objects in the Kuiper Belt offer hints about what the solar system looked like early in its history. Pluto's icy surface could help refine theories about how water spread through the solar system, and studying its atmosphere could help scientists better understand atmospheric processes on Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft's flyby of Pluto and its five known moons will provide the first close-up view of the mountains and valleys of the unknown world, and its tenuous atmosphere seen as the sun rises and sets behind it. Instruments on New Horizons might even find evidence that it snows on the tiny world.\n\nThe mission team will not celebrate until New Horizons contacts Earth again, which is expected at 9 p.m. EDT on Tuesday. The first high-resolution pictures from the pass should be released later on Wednesday. Scientists are in for a long wait to learn everything New Horizons sees, as the probe will collect so much information as it passes Pluto that it will take 16 months to send it all back to Earth.\n\nThere is a small possibility that New Horizons could be lost as it flies through the Pluto system. Any stray icy debris would be lethal if it collides with the spacecraft at its 14km/s velocity (31,000mph). As an insurance policy, the mission team downlinked one last set of data from all seven of the probe's instruments on", "answers": ["This is one of the biggest days in the exploration of our solar system since Voyager 2 approached Neptune in 1989—and there may not be a day like it again. According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.
