Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.

A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot \"can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence.

But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked.

She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel—who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945—says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections.

The incursion was brief and limited, and Gadhafi’s forces even apologized locally, Reuters reports. But Tunisia’s foreign ministry still issued a statement expressing “extreme indignation” and demanding “measures to put an immediate stop to these violations.” But Tunisia has proven remarkably welcoming to Libyans who aren’t fighting. Some 30,000 refugees have fled there, and the vast majority of them have been welcomed into the homes of Tunisians, the New York Times reports. Only about 2,500 have had to settle in the relatively small refugee camp at the border. “It’s the first time I’ve seen such an impressive response,” says a spokesman for the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1770}

A flotilla of recreational boats and jet skis rushed to the scene, pulling people from the boat as it went down and avoiding an even deadlier tragedy, the AP reports. Dramatic videos circulating on social media show the party boat rocking back and forth as people crawled down from a fourth-floor roof as it began sinking into the water. \"Those on the first and second floors sank immediately,\" a female survivor told Teleantioquia. \"The boat was sinking and all we could do was scream and call for help.\" Survivors described hearing a loud explosion near the men's bathroom that knocked out power a few minutes after the boat began its cruise around the lake. It's unclear what caused the boat to sink, but survivors said that it appeared to be overloaded and nobody on board was wearing a life vest.

Accused of repeatedly using racial slurs, people began to take screenshots and call her out on it, reports the Houston Chronicle. Hay, her school's varsity cheer captain and yearbook editor, apologized on Twitter at 2am Sunday: \"I admit that I have used language publicly in the past which I am not proud of and that there is no excuse for. Through hard work, education and thanks in large part to the sisterhood that I have come to know through pageants, I am proud to say that I am today a better person.\" Former Miss Teen USA Kamie Crawford issued her own message on Twitter: \"If you win any pageant—first things first. Clean up your page. Because if you're under 21, you shouldn't be drinking and if you're white, the N-word ain't your word.\" The Miss Universe Organization, parent company of Miss Teen USA, tells ABC News that while Hay's language was \"unacceptable at any age,\" she will keep her crown because she \"learned many lessons through those personal struggles that reshaped her life and values.\" Meanwhile, E! News reports that model Chrissy Teigen took issue with the final five, who were all white and blond. \"Wow how can we choose from such a diverse bunch,\" she tweeted, later adding, \"It's fiiiiiine.

But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says. More than 80 years after his death, Rosenwald still inspires. \"Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\" says Kempner, but \"we can all do something.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2028}

They also searched the homes of six people—including, reportedly, suspect Michael Adebolajo's father's home. Neither these two conspirators nor the wounded alleged killers have been charged yet. Other developments include: Police also haven't identified any of the suspects, but Adebolajo's name was widely reported yesterday, and today the Telegraph has identified the other alleged knife-man as the confusingly similarly named Michael Adebowale, 22. Neighbors identified Adebowale after police armed with submachine guns raided his flat yesterday, emerging with two children, a baby, and two large envelopes. Adebowale was apparently known for distributing radical Islamist leaflets, and his girlfriend had recently converted to Islam. \"When you walked past, you would hear them singing Muslim songs,\" one neighbor says, adding that she \"saw the man who was in the video go inside the house. I think he was a boyfriend.\" Rigby, \"was due to come up this weekend,\" his wife tells the Guardian. \"You don't expect it to happen when he's in the UK. You think they're safe.\" The Daily Mirror has uncovered video that purports to show the two suspects rushing at police and getting shot. There's also been a great deal of hand-wringing over MI5's failure to identify the stabbers ahead of time.

Now the manufacturer, Spin Master, is facing a class-action lawsuit from a California mom who alleges her child's egg was a dud. The lawsuit, filed by Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield, Calif., on behalf of what the suit says could be millions of consumers, claims Spin Master ran \"a bait-and-switch marketing scheme.\" Hatchimals are plush animals stuffed into plastic eggs that, when the egg is rubbed and cuddled for about half an hour, should begin to peck their way out. While Spin Master acknowledges some of the toys didn't work as intended, the company tells CNBC it \"provided troubleshooting support and where required immediately made available replacement products.\" The toy cost about $50 in stores, but it was so popular it spawned internet bidding up to $350—only to leave many buyers disappointed. One customer wrote on Amazon.com that she \"watched every YouTube video we could for help, but to no avail,\" the lawsuit says, per NBC News. Others complained that calling Spin Master had done no good because the company was \"impossible to contact,\" or that when they got through they were told to open the egg themselves. Spin Master blames the toy's popularity, saying the company \"experienced a higher than anticipated number of calls\" over the holidays, and that the lawsuit's allegations are \"not based on actual facts.\" But an attorney on the case tells Courthouse News that the toy's failure rate is \"exceptionally high,\" and that the company knew the product wasn't ready for market. Hejduk's lawyer, Mark Geragos, tells ABC News his client was never offered a refund for her defective Hatchimal."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2660}

As predicted by authorities in Haiti, UNESCO experts say there is \"indisputable proof\" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the BBC. UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area. Marine archaeologist Barry Clifford, who first investigated the wreck 11 years ago, says Columbus-era lombard cannons spotted in the area are crucial pieces of evidence that now appear to have been looted from the site, the Independent reports. \"The lombards are the smoking guns and, in my view, the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the Santa Maria,\" he says. (Columbus wrote about the 1492 sinking of the Santa Maria in his journal, but one historian believes that the explorer lied about the ship's fate as part of a spy plot.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2132}

The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham. The criminal neglect charges are still pending, though Sarah Markham's attorney—Mark O'Mara, who defended George Zimmerman—says he expects they will be dismissed now.

Raisman, who says she's \"angry\" and \"really upset\" about what happened to her and others, originally addressed in August the many accusations against Nassar, but at the time she didn't get into her own history with Nassar. She said then that she preferred to shine the spotlight on the overall scandal and to get more people \"to talk about it.\" Per the Lansing State Journal, more than 140 women and girls have filed suits related to his alleged sexual misconduct, with nearly as many reporting him to the cops. Now, however, Raisman is talking about her own experience, telling 60 Minutes: \"I just want to create change\" so other young girls \"never, ever have to go through this.\" She says she met with the FBI after the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Nassar, who was USA Gymnastics' team doctor for almost two decades, was fired in 2015 and is facing nearly two dozen sexual assault charges against him; he's also set to be sentenced next month on three federal child pornography charges.

A tiny chapel 17 miles northeast of Green Bay, Wisc., called Our Lady of Good Hope joins the likes of Mexico's Our Lady of Guadalupe and France's shrine at Lourdes, both of which draw millions each year. In 1859, a Belgian immigrant named Adele Brise said Mary—a dazzling white figure with cascading blond hair and a crown of stars, hovering between a pair of trees—appeared to her three times and instructed her to spend her life teaching Catholic beliefs to children. A two-year investigation that concluded on Dec. 8 found no evidence of fraud or heresy, but did find a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures, and other indications of divine intervention, leading Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay to declare “with moral certainty” that Brise had encounters “of a supernatural character” that are “worthy of belief.” The Vatican, wary of fraud, gives local bishops the primary responsibility of evaluating apparitions, in part by using guidelines set by the Vatican in 1978.

And so it's just passe at this juncture,\" Playboy CEO Scott Flanders tells the paper. The change apparently has the approval of 89-year-old founder and editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner, the BBC reports. The magazine will still feature racy photos of women, but analysts say the removal of nudes will be a big boost for its articles, including serious journalism and interviews, CNN reports. Flanders tells the Times that the target audience will be young, urban men. \"The difference between us and Vice is that we're going after the guy with a job,\" he quips. The Playboy company now makes most of its money from licensing its brand, and Flanders tells the Times that the magazine loses around $3 million a year in the US, which is a cost the firm sees as an expense for their \"Fifth Avenue storefront.\" The Times notes that the Playboy website became SFW and got rid of nudes last year, which execs say caused traffic to quadruple to 16 million users a month.

Why are you overreacting?'\" Clemmons explains she feels comfortable saying this about Dunham, as she's known her since they were both in college, when Dunham and her rich friends \"had a lot of power and seemed to get off on simultaneously wielding it and denying it.\" Clemmons adds that someone close to her was \"victimized\" back then by \"someone in Lena's circle\" and that he \"continues to move in those circles and has a powerful job.\" She says she stayed at Lenny only because she had a good relationship with the editors there, but that now \"it is time for women of color—black women in particular—to divest from Lena Dunham.\" Jezebel points out a string of other tweets Clemmons posted on the subject, including calling Dunham's online apology a \"half-assed attempt to cover your ass.\" Clemmons also doesn't seem fazed by her detractors. \"To all the haters, harassers and abusers creeping into my timeline, remember this: I brought down a major celebrity and her publication with one Facebook post.

According to McAfee, some Netflix accounts were being sold for as low as 50 cents, while accounts for premium sports streaming services top the list at $15. Not only are these prices incredibly low, but many sellers are offering a lifetime guarantee, Tech Insider reports. That means if the account you bought for a buck gets shut down, the seller will simply give you another one. According to McAfee, this illicit marketplace isn't just bad news for the streaming services themselves; it can have repercussions for the actual account holders, too. Your account could be closed because of something the Dark Web buyer does, or the buyer could make purchases using your stored credit card information.

Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director Ridley Scott of 1979's Alien returning: The filmmakers have finally managed to \"dig the series out of its hole,\" Todd McCarthy puts it at the Hollywood Reporter. He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender—who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots—also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2356}

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

Charges included illegal gathering, weapons possession, and thuggery; rights groups called the ruling \"politicized.\" \"I can't separate his arrest from the girls' case,\" says another lawyer defending the women, whose appeal is set to be heard Saturday. \"This means that any lawyer who comes close to the case will be detained.\" Though the women were clamoring for Morsi's reinstatement, he added that the lawyer, Ahmed El-Hamrawy, \"was part of Morsi's opposition. He demonstrated against him on June 30, but he's been involved in defending freedoms since July 3 ... He's being punished for that.\" Authorities have long cracked down on Islamists who supported Morsi, but lately, they've been targeting young, secular demonstrators, the AP notes. A new rule bans gatherings of more than 10 people without prior notice."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2085}

The film is directed and co-written by British anti-vaccination activist Andrew Wakefield, who was stripped of his medical license for ethics violations, reports the New York Times. Wakefield was behind a controversial 1998 study linking vaccines to autism, which was later discredited and retracted by the medical journal that published it. \"Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined,\" De Niro said, per Variety. He said that in the 15 years since he founded the festival, he has never been involved in programming, but \"this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening Vaxxed.

And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause \"suspicion.\" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: \"He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,\" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports.

Analysis of the tool—which is made from orange agate not usually found in the area—revealed it had been used to butcher an animal believed to be the extinct buffalo species Bison antiquus, KTVZ reports. University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady says the team plans to keep excavating the site after the \"tantalizing\" find, which may be older than any other find predating the Clovis people once thought to be the first in North America, NBC News reports. University of Washington professor of archaeology Donald K. Grayson, however, predicts there will be a lot of skepticism about the find. \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he tells the AP. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" (Experts believe they have found evidence of a long-lost civilization in the Honduran rainforest.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1460}

He was not allowed to return to China, however, but nor was he given Indian citizenship. He lived in a kind of limbo. \"I cried in the night,\" Wang says of those first years in India. \"I missed my mother.\" He eventually married, worked at a flour mill, and had children and grandchildren, but he never stopped hoping to return home. A spokesperson for the Chinese government blames Indian bureaucracy for preventing Wang's return over the past half-century. But after being visited by a delegation from the Chinese embassy in recent weeks, visas were procured for Wang and his relatives. His wife was too sick to travel, but Wang arrived in Beijing on Friday with his adult children, where they were met by his surviving relatives. This is only a visit, however. \"My family is (in India),\" he says. \"Where would I go?\" (For this soldier, WWII didn't end until 1974.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2303}

Qualifying rounds have begun, and officials will decide, based on conditions, whether semifinals and finals should take place tonight as planned. Yesterday, officials were working to improve the halfpipe. Yesterday's practice—postponed from the morning for improvements—didn't inspire confidence among the athletes. \"I saw everyone take a hard fall today. That never happens,\" Teter said. Is it dangerous? \"It's just not as fun,\" says teammate Danny Davis. Athletes said the halfpipe, which Shaun White calls \"disappointing,\" was bumpy, its curvature was off, and the snow was loose; and those who avoided falling yesterday struggled to maintain speed, leading to less aggressive tricks. But the Times notes that halfpipe quality can fluctuate wildly depending on weather conditions and how it's maintained. Still, \"this is going to be showcased to billions of people, and we want the best representation of halfpipe snowboarding,\" Teter says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2465}

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1889}

With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today. The film's \"jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness.\" And though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \"Unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.\" It \"seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison. At least \"Ferrell and Hart have a genial, easygoing chemistry,\" Hornaday writes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1518}

This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the Wall Street Journal.

What the former La Porte mail carrier is accused of doing with the backlogged mail: hoarding 6,000 pieces of it in his home, as well as paying an accomplice $50 per bundle to dispose of about 11,000 pieces of mail by burning it in Michigan. The still-unnamed helper, however, reportedly instead dumped the mail in a Michigan ravine, where it was found in February 2017. The USPS traced the mail back to Block, and he's said to have feigned ignorance when first approached about it. But court documents note that once some of the recovered mail was shown to him, Block said: \"Looks like I'm going to jail.\" He then admitted he'd fallen behind on his shifts and started taking undelivered mail home. One La Porte resident tells WSBT 22 it was a \"crapshoot\" on whether he'd get his mail or not during the six-month period in question—late 2016 to the time of Block's resignation in February 2017—and that he finally just got a PO Box. A statement from a USPS Office of Inspector General spokesman notes that \"the vast majority of US Postal Service personnel are ... hardworking public servants dedicated to moving mail to its proper destination who would never consider engaging in any form of criminal behavior.\" Meanwhile, a La Porte post office rep says they're trying to figure out which customers would have been affected, per WLS."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1564}

The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

He pressed: \"What parent would do this?\" As the Guardian reports, one of Powell's complaints is that his son was disqualified only after bowling a 171-point game that propelled his Riverdale team to the title in the Newfoundland city of St. John's.\" After the story made headlines in Canada, an odd-sounding compromise was reached.

The increases range from a few dollars in some states to nearly $1,000 per worker in Hawaii. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" says an economist at the Brookings Institution. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\" Times are tough, however: Twenty-five states have borrowed a total of $25 billion from the federal government to keep up with jobless benefits, and another nine will be in the red by mid-year, reports ProPublica."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1440}

The move came after DNA evidence linked those assaults to a serial attacker known as the Teardrop Rapist, so labeled for having a teardrop tattoo under his eye, the AP notes. That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"You can sentence me to all the years you want, but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there,\" Vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, Vargas reached out to the California Innocence Project and asked to use DNA techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the Times. The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist. The three victims had positively IDed Vargas as the perpetrator, but an Innocence Project attorney tells the AP it was a \"shaky witness\" case, an assertion the LA district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the Times notes.

The lake, located in the Gale Crater, would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide. The lake's mudstones—which form in calm, still water—contain traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, meaning it could have supported chemolithoautotrophs, a kind of microbial that obtains energy by breaking down rock minerals. The lake was revealed today amidst a barrage of papers on the Rover's progress. National Geographic breaks down some of the other key take-aways, including one that's less promising for Martian life hunters: Curiosity's first radiation measurements indicate levels that would be fatal, within a few million years, to anything within several meters of the surface.

Ford's campaign promises included cutting gasoline taxes, lowering the minimum price of beer to $1, and making marijuana more widely available after it is legalized this year, reports the Toronto Star. \"He had a simple product, and he was selling it at a lower price than anybody else in terms of tax cuts and other commitments of reduced prices, whether it was for gas and beer etc.,\" political science professor Myer Siemiatycki tells the CBC. Days before the election, Rob Ford's widow, Renata Ford, filed a $12.6 million lawsuit against Doug Ford and Randy Ford, another Ford brother, accusing them of mismanaging the family business and cheating her and her children out of her husband's inheritance."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2954}

Coronel says she only saw her husband twice during his months as a fugitive last year. \"He just wanted to have a nice time with his daughters,\" she says. \"To be in peace.\" She claims to know little of Guzman's drug empire and says she has never seen him use drugs or violence. \"He is like any other man—of course he is not violent, not rude,\" she says. \"I have never heard him say a bad word.

The first occurred when 19-year-old Nick Silvestri hopped up on the stage just before the start of Hand to God and plugged his phone into an outlet, not realizing it was a prop. He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone. \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he recalls. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized. \"I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,\" he said, per Gothamist. (Variety notes that Hand to God, which has been struggling to sell tickets, was happy to capitalize by organizing that press conference.) The second incident occurred when Patti LuPone took the phone from an audience member who was texting during Show for Days. Given that she remained in character the whole time, the New York Post grants her a \"standing ovation.\" Vanity Fair rounds up previous incidents, saying they \"offer proof that, even if our movie theaters are slowly succumbing to the inevitability of omnipresent cell phones, the theater community may well choose to die on this hill.\" Plus, Broadway actors have a big advantage over movie actors: \"the ability to fight back.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2745}

The office of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which its executive director says is situated in an \"old\" and \"deteriorated\" building, couldn't move the materials to their intended destination due to budgetary issues related to shipping.

A joint US-Mexico team, however, managed to rediscover the species found by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936 by using his original field notes to retrace his steps and search for the nocturnal snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations, the AP reports. The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Island snake is a unique species, reports the BBC. The snake is related to snakes found on part of the Mexican coast more than 500 miles away, and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago. Beebe returned from a visit to the island, located 400-plus miles off Mexico's Pacific coast, nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar, but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The National Museum of Natural History praised the team's work, describing the snake as the \"only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" The rediscovery \"is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,\" the museum said in a statement."], "all_classes": null, "length": 999}

However, that's less the case when the \"broken picnic table\" was actually a 6,000-year-old tomb under government protection. NPR reports the tomb is believed to have been built by Neolithic Celtic settlers in what is now the town of San Cristovo de Cea in Spain. After removing the granite slabs they thought had been parts of a bench, workers poured concrete into the burial chamber and topped it off with a picnic table. A Spanish archaeologist tells the Local he was \"horrified\" by the \"monumental error\" after an environmental group discovered what had happened in June. Town officials say they weren't aware the tomb was even there, despite it being listed as a heritage site. \"No one told me,\" the mayor tells El Huffington Post. \"The site wasn't even marked.\" But a regional government department is investigating the situation and tells the Local \"the town council was well aware of its existence.\" According to NPR, this kind of thing isn't unheard of. Two years ago, workers in Belize accidentally ruined a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid because they needed rubble to fix a road. But more often these ancient sites are destroyed on purpose. Last year, for example, developers dismantled a Native American burial ground in California to make room for some million-dollar homes.

Charles, a 42-year-old citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, was initially detained when he disembarked Caribbean Airlines Flight 520 and appeared \"visibly nervous,\" avoiding eye contact; customs officers were examining his suitcase at the time, CBS New York reports, and they brought him to a private search room. That's when they noticed his gait and patted him down, the New York Daily News reports. The drugs he was allegedly carrying are worth more than $70,000 on the street, according to authorities.

The leaders will have six hours of talks, a private dinner, and walks around the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage to try to achieve it.

(The AP doesn't think the story is bombshell material—it notes that the White House released a declassified version of the president's directive in January.)

The FBI says the other four devices found will be encased in blastproof material and taken to the agency's headquarters for further investigation, the New York Times reports. The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast—which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"—and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low—but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 6707}

At 7pm CT, Iowa Republicans will gather to cast the first votes in the Republican nominating season. Consider this your pregame report, with info from Politico, Mother Jones, and the Des Moines Register: The frontrunners: Polls show Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum are poised to grab the proverbial “three tickets out of Iowa.” Romney doesn’t need to win to remain the favorite for the nomination, but anything less than a respectable second will be damaging. Turnout is everything: If it’s high, that’s probably a good sign for Romney. If it’s low, it’s a good sign for Paul and/or Santorum—depending on where it’s concentrated. Bad weather is thought to favor Paul’s band of enthusiastic supporters. Location, location, location: Romney’s support is strongest in eastern Iowa, Santorum should fare well in the northwest, and Paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as Ames. Politico highlights 10 counties to watch here. The battle for fourth: If either Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry can pull out a closer-than-expected fourth, they might be able to stay in the race. Last-minute campaigning: Romney held rallies in four cities yesterday, his most since 2008. Paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in Des Moines, hoping to grab media buzz. And Santorum appeared with the cast of 19 Kids and Counting, the TLC reality show beloved by Iowa homeschoolers. Some intriguing numbers: Paul’s favorability has fallen 21 points in the past week. Only 76% of Santorum’s supporters say they’ll definitely caucus for him. Romney, meanwhile, has at some point trailed five different candidates in Iowa—and is now polling at exactly the same 18% he was at in January."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4291}

So far 11 of the quarantined have tested negative for Marburg, though they may be retested in a few days if the symptoms they've developed don't disappear. And those symptoms might sound familiar if you've been following the Ebola situation: Both viruses are members of the Filovirus family and manifest in similar ways, including fever, severe headache, and major bleeding, the Washington Post reports. Although many of the outbreaks recorded since Marburg was IDed in 1967 have been single cases, the fatality rate ranges from 23% to 90% (if you discount those single-case years), the CDC notes. Perhaps to mitigate increasing concern over Ebola after Thomas Duncan's death in Texas this week, CDC Director Thomas Frieden has been talking up efforts the CDC has undertaken in Uganda and emphasized that no further Marburg cases have been documented. \"That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa,\" he says, per CNN.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed.

And as the current SI article notes, he didn't go back to his hometown of Bernice, La., or keep in touch with teammates or relatives. Instead, he became what SI says was \"a jheri-curled version of a phantom.\" \"It's like he turned the lights out on his existence,\" an ex-Houston player says in the documentary. But Rives, with the help of former teammate and ex-Chicago cop Eric Davis, followed a bunch of leads until they tracked him down in a rental apartment outside of Detroit. The SI reveal doesn't tell much about Anders' current state of affairs, other than noting he works in a local restaurant and \"looks good … weighing far less than 350 pounds, as was rumored.\" Fans will have to wait for the ESPN movie to find out more.

The USS George Washington and two US cruisers have arrived in the Philippines and will distribute food, water, and medicine, as well as assist search and rescue operations in what the top US commander in the Philippines tells the BBC will be an American aid effort on an unprecedented scale. US planes are bringing in supplies and a medical ship is on the way; Britain is also sending an aircraft carrier, notes the BBC. In other developments: Supplies from the US and other countries are arriving, but some areas are still in desperate need of relief and \"the major challenge is logistics,\" a European Commission spokesman tells the LA Times. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities—military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross—trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" Lawlessness in the devastated city of Tacloban is also slowing the distribution of aid, the Guardian finds. A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of Tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from California is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, NBC finds. The volunteer surgeons—working by flashlight in Tanawan's ruined town hall—believe the region will need help for months. \"I don’t know when or how we are going to be able to leave,\" one doctor says. \"This is just the beginning of a wave of misery.\" USA Today has more on that front: The few doctors in Manila are already overwhelmed with hundreds of patients—and those are mostly minor injuries. They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration. And the New York Times looks at a hospital in Tacloban that has no power, where victims lay waiting for care.

Eva Cuypers and her team at the University of Leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds—called esters—were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports. The esters create a \"singular chemical cocktail\" in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells, including other dead animals, Science reports. Cuypers and her team published their findings last week. They believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job. And Discovery points out the synthetic smell of decomposing human bodies could prove popular at Halloween parties. Experts have questioned components of the research—including the separation of tissue and organs—and Cuypers plans a follow-up study using full bodies buried in a field, Science reports.
