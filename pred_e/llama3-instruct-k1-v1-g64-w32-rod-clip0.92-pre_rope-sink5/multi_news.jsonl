Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.

Michael David Elliot, 40, allegedly stole a woman's red jeep and abandoned it in the small town of Shipshewana, Indiana, this afternoon. A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot \"can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence. Then a call about a stolen vehicle came in to the LaPorte County Sheriff's Office, and a deputy saw the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, WOOD-TV reports. But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked. He was serving five life sentences for the murders of four people when he broke out of the Ionia Correctional Facility yesterday by slipping through a gap in the fencing system."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1950}
