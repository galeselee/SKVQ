Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.

A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot \"can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence.

But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked.

She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel—who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945—says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections.

The incursion was brief and limited, and Gadhafi’s forces even apologized locally, Reuters reports. But Tunisia’s foreign ministry still issued a statement expressing “extreme indignation” and demanding “measures to put an immediate stop to these violations.” But Tunisia has proven remarkably welcoming to Libyans who aren’t fighting. Some 30,000 refugees have fled there, and the vast majority of them have been welcomed into the homes of Tunisians, the New York Times reports. Only about 2,500 have had to settle in the relatively small refugee camp at the border. “It’s the first time I’ve seen such an impressive response,” says a spokesman for the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1770}

Rescuers including firefighters and air force pilots in helicopters searched for survivors at the Guatape reservoir where El Almirante ferry sank. A flotilla of recreational boats and jet skis rushed to the scene, pulling people from the boat as it went down and avoiding an even deadlier tragedy, the AP reports. Dramatic videos circulating on social media show the party boat rocking back and forth as people crawled down from a fourth-floor roof as it began sinking into the water. \"Those on the first and second floors sank immediately,\" a female survivor told Teleantioquia. \"The boat was sinking and all we could do was scream and call for help.\" Survivors described hearing a loud explosion near the men's bathroom that knocked out power a few minutes after the boat began its cruise around the lake. It's unclear what caused the boat to sink, but survivors said that it appeared to be overloaded and nobody on board was wearing a life vest. After arriving at the scene, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said 122 people were either rescued or found their way to shore, but six had died and another 31 were missing, he told reporters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 731}
