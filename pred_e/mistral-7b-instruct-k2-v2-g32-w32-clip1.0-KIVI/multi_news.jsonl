These proteins, which prevent freezing by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals, also inhibit melting, leading to the potential accumulation of ice in the fish's bodies.\n\nIn a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of scientists found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP) both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples, solutions of purified AFPs, and in live fishes. This superheated ice persisted inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 hours, and at a lower temperature for at least several days.\n\nField experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild notothenioid fishes. However, over a long-term temperature record (1999–2012) from a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, it was found that summer warming did not reliably eliminate internal ice due to the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal, revealed that the ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely exceed the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives. This could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams inside small capillaries, but it could also help them stay cool under pressure.\n\nThe long-term cost of this life-saving protein is a question for further research, as it remains unknown whether there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies. The highest concentration of ice crystals was found in the fishes' spleens, suggesting that this organ may be trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThese findings provide a better understanding of the progression of all species and the potential unintended consequences of evolutionary innovations. The researchers emphasize that evolution is a stepwise", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

This decline is causing concern as it affects numerous species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the health of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment from 2013 to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is attributed to their dependence on the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. The sardine fishery collapsed in the 1950s and the current population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000.\n\nForage fish, including sardines, account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water, about $11.3 billion, due to their value as food for commercially important predators.\n\nThe steepest sardine decline is being experienced by fishermen, with the sardine crash making schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if sardines do not recover soon.\n\nThe cause of the decline is unclear, but it is believed to be a combination of natural climate cycles and overfishing.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The film, which premiered last week, has been criticized for its portrayal of racial stereotypes and homophobic humor. Audiences and critics have voiced concerns about the movie's handling of racial issues and its depiction of a character's fear of being raped in prison, which includes an attempt to have oral sex with a gay man in a bathroom stall.\n\nThe film's creators, including director Ethan Cohen, writers Jay Martel and Ian Roberts, and producers Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, have defended their work, claiming that it is a satire of stereotypes rather than a representation of them.

The CDC and The Pew Charitable Trusts have collaborated to analyze antibiotic use in outpatient settings, including doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics.\n\nThe study found that approximately 30% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, amounting to about 47 million prescriptions annually, are unnecessary. Most of these prescriptions are for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, and flu, which are viral illnesses.\n\nThe findings suggest that a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary to meet the White House's goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use by 50% in outpatient settings by 2020.\n\nThe CDC estimates that at least 23,000 people die annually in the U.S. from antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat, with bacteria becoming increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics.\n\nHealthcare providers, patients, and the healthcare industry as a whole can take steps to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. These steps include implementing stewardship programs, providing education to patients about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use, and using diagnostics to aid in prescribing decisions.\n\nThe CDC and The Pew Charitable Trusts are also working on a similar report on inappropriate antibiotic use in hospitals, which will be released in 2017. The CDC is also planning to release an updated AR Threats Report in fall 2019.\n\nIn conclusion, the overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, a major public health threat.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm) compared to south-facing panels. This translates to a 65% reduction in electricity draw from the grid during peak demand hours for homes with west-facing panels, compared to a 54% reduction for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels could be more effective for homeowners, particularly during summer afternoons when electricity usage and grid stress are highest due to increased air conditioning use. This is because west-facing panels capture solar energy more effectively during the late afternoon, a time when solar power generation aligns with increased electricity demand and utility company needs.\n\nThe study's results have the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, as it challenges the long-held belief that east-west roof pitches are not suitable for solar installation. The study also suggests that homeowners may be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during summer months, and its overall outcome in winter months remains uncertain. Additionally, the effectiveness of west-facing solar panels may vary depending on the region, as factors such as cloud cover and utility incentives can influence solar panel performance.\n\nThe study has sparked discussions within the solar industry, with some industry experts calling for a reevaluation of the traditional south-is-best rule-of-thumb and urging utilities to reconsider their opposition to west-facing solar panels. However, some utility companies, such as Southern California Edison, continue to recommend a south orientation for solar panels.\n\nOverall, the study raises important questions about the optimal orientation of solar panels and the need for more precise testing and analysis of solar panel performance in real-world settings.
