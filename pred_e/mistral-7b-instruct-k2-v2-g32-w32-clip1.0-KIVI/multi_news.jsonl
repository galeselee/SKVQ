These proteins, which prevent freezing by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals, also inhibit melting, leading to the potential accumulation of ice in the fish's bodies.\n\nIn a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of scientists found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP) both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples, solutions of purified AFPs, and in live fishes. This superheated ice persisted inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 hours, and at a lower temperature for at least several days.\n\nField experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild notothenioid fishes. However, over a long-term temperature record (1999–2012) from a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, it was found that summer warming did not reliably eliminate internal ice due to the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal, revealed that the ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely exceed the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives. This could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams inside small capillaries, but it could also help them stay cool under pressure.\n\nThe long-term cost of this life-saving protein is a question for further research, as it remains unknown whether there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies. The highest concentration of ice crystals was found in the fishes' spleens, suggesting that this organ may be trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThese findings provide a better understanding of the progression of all species and the potential unintended consequences of evolutionary innovations. The researchers emphasize that evolution is a stepwise", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

This decline is causing concern as it affects numerous species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to take action to protect the health of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment from 2013 to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored.\n\nThe decline in sardine population is attributed to their dependence on the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. The sardine fishery collapsed in the 1950s and the current population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000.\n\nForage fish, including sardines, account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water, about $11.3 billion, due to their value as food for commercially important predators.\n\nThe steepest sardine decline is being experienced by fishermen, with the sardine crash making schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if sardines do not recover soon.\n\nThe cause of the decline is unclear, but it is believed to be a combination of natural climate cycles and overfishing.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The film, which premiered last week, has been criticized for its portrayal of racial stereotypes and homophobic humor. Audiences and critics have voiced concerns about the movie's handling of racial issues and its depiction of a character's fear of being raped in prison, which includes an attempt to have oral sex with a gay man in a bathroom stall.\n\nThe film's creators, including director Ethan Cohen, writers Jay Martel and Ian Roberts, and producers Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, have defended their work, claiming that it is a satire of stereotypes rather than a representation of them.

The CDC and The Pew Charitable Trusts have collaborated to analyze antibiotic use in outpatient settings, including doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics.\n\nThe study found that approximately 30% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, amounting to about 47 million prescriptions annually, are unnecessary. Most of these prescriptions are for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, and flu, which are viral illnesses.\n\nThe findings suggest that a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary to meet the White House's goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use by 50% in outpatient settings by 2020.\n\nThe CDC estimates that at least 23,000 people die annually in the U.S. from antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat, with bacteria becoming increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics.\n\nHealthcare providers, patients, and the healthcare industry as a whole can take steps to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. These steps include implementing stewardship programs, providing education to patients about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use, and using diagnostics to aid in prescribing decisions.\n\nThe CDC and The Pew Charitable Trusts are also working on a similar report on inappropriate antibiotic use in hospitals, which will be released in 2017. The CDC is also planning to release an updated AR Threats Report in fall 2019.\n\nIn conclusion, the overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, a major public health threat.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The study, which analyzed 50 homes with solar panels, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7pm) compared to south-facing panels. This translates to a 65% reduction in electricity draw from the grid during peak demand hours for homes with west-facing panels, compared to a 54% reduction for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels could be more effective for homeowners, particularly during summer afternoons when electricity usage and grid stress are highest due to increased air conditioning use. This is because west-facing panels capture solar energy more effectively during the late afternoon, a time when solar power generation aligns with increased electricity demand and utility company needs.\n\nThe study's results have the potential to significantly impact the residential solar market, as it challenges the long-held belief that east-west roof pitches are not suitable for solar installation. The study also suggests that homeowners may be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand and off-peak hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study was conducted during summer months, and its overall outcome in winter months remains uncertain. Additionally, the effectiveness of west-facing solar panels may vary depending on the region, as factors such as cloud cover and utility incentives can influence solar panel performance.\n\nThe study has sparked discussions within the solar industry, with some industry experts calling for a reevaluation of the traditional south-is-best rule-of-thumb and urging utilities to reconsider their opposition to west-facing solar panels. However, some utility companies, such as Southern California Edison, continue to recommend a south orientation for solar panels.\n\nOverall, the study raises important questions about the optimal orientation of solar panels and the need for more precise testing and analysis of solar panel performance in real-world settings.

The study found that for women with early-stage breast cancer who meet certain criteria, removing cancerous lymph nodes does not improve survival, reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, or change the treatment plan. This discovery turns conventional wisdom on its head, as surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for over a century, believing it would prevent the cancer from spreading and improve survival rates.\n\nThe study, which was funded by the National Cancer Institute, involved 891 patients with early-stage breast cancer (T1 or T2) whose biopsies showed cancer in one or two armpit lymph nodes but not large enough to be felt during an exam. These patients underwent lumpectomy, radiation to the entire breast, and either chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. They were then randomly assigned to have 10 or more nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. The study found that over 5 years, there was no difference in survival rates between the two groups, with over 90% of patients surviving. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar.\n\nThe study's findings are part of a trend towards less radical surgery for breast cancer, as doctors now understand that the disease can spread early and that surgery alone may not be enough to eradicate it. The modern approach is to remove obvious tumors and use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other areas. However, the belief that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be removed has persisted, and until recently, the number of cancerous lymph nodes was used to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. However, the number of nodes is no longer often used to determine drug treatment, and what matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all.\n\nThe new findings do not apply to all patients, only to those whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study. The study's authors and experts suggest that the findings may take time to be widely accepted, as the belief in removing lymph nodes is deeply ingrained.

The authors of the studies emphasized that more research is needed to confirm these findings and to establish a causal relationship between potato consumption and gestational diabetes.\n\nDr. Cuilin Zhang, a senior investigator at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, suggested that green leafy vegetables and whole grains could be good alternatives to potatoes due to their lower glycemic index and higher nutritional content.\n\nDr. Minisha Sood, the director of inpatient diabetes at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, found the study's approach of focusing on a high-glycemic food like potatoes interesting.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap.

The first report, published in the journal Nature, indicates that Antarctica is shedding ice at an alarming rate, with approximately 200 billion tonnes of ice being lost annually since 2012, a three-fold increase from the last assessment in 2012. This accelerating ice loss is causing global sea levels to rise by 0.6mm each year, with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula being the regions most affected.\n\nThe second report, released by an international team of ice experts, reveals that Antarctica has lost about 3 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, with the southern-most continent's ice sheet melting enough to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet (4 meters). This melting has caused global oceans to rise by about three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). The study, which involved 88 co-authors and multiple satellites, ground, and air measurements, suggests that Antarctica could contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century.\n\nThe third report, also published in Nature, suggests that the East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2 million to 5 million years ago, even when heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels were similar to what they are now. This finding contradicts the idea that East Antarctica might be vulnerable to rapid melting in a warming climate.\n\nThe accelerating ice loss in Antarctica is a cause for concern, with scientists warning that the forces driving these changes will not improve in a warming climate. The primary cause of the melt is warmer water, which is melting the floating edges of ice sheets from below. The warming of the southern ocean is connected to shifting winds, which are connected to global warming from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nThe latest findings highlight the urgent need for governments to take account of the accelerating trend in Antarctica as they plan future defenses to protect low-lying coastal communities from rising sea levels.", "answers": ["Scientists monitoring ice loss in Antarctica have chilling news: The melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year, according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal Nature.

The stone was found with the gold plates that Smith used to translate the Book of Mormon, which he claimed were given to him by an angel in 1823. The church has been releasing historical documents and clarifying sensitive tenets in recent years as part of a push to be more transparent and fill a void of accurate information on the internet. The stone will remain in the church's vault, but the photos are part of a new book that also contains photos of the first printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe Book of Mormon was translated from the gold plates using two instruments: the Urim and Thummim, a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim, and a seer stone, a small oval stone that Smith discovered in the ground before finding the gold plates. Smith used these instruments to look into a hat and read the English words that appeared on them. The translation process is not fully understood, but it is believed to have been done \"by the gift and power of God.\"\n\nThe translation of the Book of Mormon took place over a short period of time, with almost all of the present text being translated in just three months in 1829. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, which still survives, supports the idea that the translation was done quickly and from another language. The printer's manuscript, which was created by Oliver Cowdery, one of Smith's scribes, also supports this idea, as it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misreading words copied from another manuscript.\n\nThe translation of the Book of Mormon was a monumental task, as it amounted to more than 500 printed pages.

At least two more women have vanished, leading some to fear a serial killer is on the loose. \"I don't want to come out and say 'yes, we have a serial killer,'\" says an officer, but he admits it's possible.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60.

Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

However, due to its extreme distance from the sun, it is difficult to observe directly as it reflects very little sunlight. The researchers have not yet observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the motion of smaller dwarf planets and other objects in the outer solar system.\n\nPlanet Nine is thought to have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. If confirmed, its discovery would reconfigure the models of the solar system. The researchers suggest that the discovery of Planet Nine could rewrite textbooks once again, as Brown's earlier discovery of Eris played a significant role in Pluto's demotion from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine could potentially lead to a reevaluation of Pluto's status, as it is larger and more massive than Pluto. However, the criteria for a planet's classification, such as clearing its orbit and having a spherical shape, would still need to be considered.\n\nThe researchers anticipate that Planet Nine could be discovered via telescope within the next couple of years. The search for Planet Nine has already begun, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant event in the field of astronomy, reconfiguring our understanding of the solar system. The researchers are hopeful that the discovery will generate excitement and inspire further research in the field.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has been met with skepticism, with some scientists questioning the evidence and suggesting alternative explanations for the observed motion of the smaller objects in the outer solar system. However, the researchers are confident in their findings and believe that the evidence is strong.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has renewed discussions about Pluto's status as a planet. While some argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet, others believe that it is important to maintain the distinction between planets and dwarf planets.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

Damascus, the capital city of Syria, is experiencing a significant change due to the war. Traffic is frequently disrupted, and movement is becoming increasingly difficult due to checkpoints and security measures. Shelling and machine-gun fire are common, and many residents are afraid to venture out after dark. The city, once known for its all-night party scene, is now a city under siege, with few people daring to go out after dark and kidnappings on the rise. The war has caused shortages of gasoline, food, and heating oil, and many residents are worried about the upcoming winter.\n\n2. The ongoing battles between rebel and government forces are taking a toll on cities across the country. The government is increasingly relying on air power to attack rebel areas, resulting in civilian casualties and destruction of buildings. In the latest incident, a string of government airstrikes on rebel areas in Idlib and Aleppo provinces killed at least 20 people and leveled buildings, forcing residents to dig through the rubble for survivors.\n\n3. The conflict in Syria is also affecting the country's economy, with businesses suffering from the violence and international sanctions. Many factories have been burned down or damaged, and international sanctions restrict the finances of wealthy Syrians. The conflict has made it difficult to distribute goods, and numerous factories have had to close or reduce production. The economy has been severely impacted, with inflation rising to at least 36 percent and the currency dropping around 50 percent.\n\n4. The Alawite minority, a sect that has traditionally supported President Bashar al-Assad, is facing increasing tensions within their community. There are rumblings of discontent within Syria's Alawite minority, presenting a new challenge to President Assad's efforts to retain power. The Alawites, who have historically been persecuted by Sunni rule, fear for their future in a Syria where Sunni Islamists may play a major role if the rebels win.

Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the US, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-Western militias. More from Syria: The rebels today blew up one oil pipeline and one gas pipeline near Deir al-Zour, the AP reports, citing state media. Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports.

The spacecraft has been traveling for nine-and-a-half years and will come within 7,800 miles of Pluto.\n\nNew Horizons has already delivered data that has been described as a \"gift for the ages.\" Some of the discoveries include Pluto being larger than previously thought, with a new measurement of 2,370 kilometers across. This increased size means that Pluto must hold more ice and less rock beneath its surface than expected.\n\nThe spacecraft has also confirmed the presence of an icy cap at Pluto's north pole, with chemical signatures of methane and nitrogen ice detected in the polar region. The images beamed back to Earth have revealed cliffs, craters, and chasms larger than the Grand Canyon. One early image showed Pluto as an orangey globe bearing a large bright spot shaped like a heart.\n\nOther instruments onboard New Horizons have confirmed that Pluto's atmosphere creates mirages that can fool ground-based telescopes.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

The transcript from the cockpit voice recorder suggests that Lubitz ignored the captain's pleas to open the door and allowed the plane to descend, leading to the crash. The transcript was leaked to the German newspaper Bild, causing concern among investigators due to its sensitive nature.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on the community response to the crash, particularly in Montabaur, the hometown of Lubitz. The pastor of the Lutheran church in Montabaur held a service to commemorate the victims and support their families. The community stands by Lubitz and his family, despite the allegations against him.\n\nPassage 3 features Airbus chairman Tom Enders' criticism of the media's handling of the crash investigation. He expressed concern over the speculation and \"outrageous nonsense\" being spread, particularly on television talk shows. He emphasized that the exception should not be considered the rule, and that the overwhelming majority of pilots are reliable and well-trained.\n\nPassage 4 discusses the ongoing search for the flight data recorder, which is still missing. Rescuers have identified 78 distinct DNA strands from the victims' remains, but the lack of a complete body has made identification difficult. The black box is crucial for understanding the exact cause of the crash, as it contains valuable data about the plane's performance in the final moments.\n\nPassage 5 reveals that Lubitz was living with a 26-year-old woman in Düsseldorf, who was a teacher at a comprehensive school in North Rhine Westphalia. She visited the crash site last week and discovered that Lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane.

The new calculations indicate the universe's expansion rate, known as the Hubble constant, is approximately 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is 5 to 9 percent faster than previous estimates. This discrepancy poses a challenge to the current understanding of the universe's expansion, as it does not align with predictions based on measurements of the afterglow of the Big Bang made by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite.\n\nThe researchers arrived at this new expansion rate by refining the distance measurements to faraway galaxies using innovative techniques that improved the precision of distance measurements. They measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars in 19 galaxies and compared the observed brightness of both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae to determine the true brightness and calculate distances to roughly 300 Type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies. Comparing these distances with the expansion of space as measured by the stretching of light from receding galaxies, they calculated the rate of the universe's expansion.\n\nThe faster expansion rate raises questions about the nature of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, which make up 95 percent of the universe and do not emit light. It is possible that dark energy is pushing galaxies apart with even greater force, or that dark matter has some as-yet undiscovered oddities. Another explanation could be the existence of a new subatomic particle traveling close to the speed of light, known as dark radiation.\n\nThe discrepancy between the new measurements and the predictions based on the Big Bang afterglow could also imply that Einstein's theory of relativity is incomplete. Researchers are continuing to analyze the data to reduce the margin of error and further investigate the cause of the discrepancy. The Hubble Space Telescope is still being used to refine the accuracy of the Hubble constant, with a goal to reach an accuracy of 1 percent.\n\nThe findings have stirred hypotheses about the unknown parts of the universe and the forces that shape its expansion.

The violence was concentrated on the West and South sides, with the heaviest amount of violence taking place between midnight and 3 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nThe shootings were traced back to gang conflicts and targeted attacks, with many occurring in large crowds and gatherings. Chicago Police Chief of Patrol Fred Waller stated that the shootings were not due to police resources being diverted to the Lollapalooza music festival. He expressed frustration that gang members do not fear repercussions from the law and take advantage of large summer crowds to use as cover to shoot into crowds.\n\nOne of the fatalities was 17-year-old Jahnae Patterson, who was shot in the face and killed in a shooting in the West Garfield Park neighborhood. Her family held an impromptu vigil to remember her, with her mother stating, \"They took my baby's life for no reason.\"\n\nThe aftermath of many of the shootings played out inside and outside hospitals, with extended family and friends being prevented from entering as staff dealt with the influx of trauma patients.

The event will bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm new innovations for breast pumps. The hackathon is a response to the lack of innovation in the field of maternal health, which is often neglected due to a lack of data and research.\n\nThe current breast pump has several issues, including a loud motor, multiple parts that are hard to clean, the inability to lay down and pump, a lack of private spaces to pump during the workday, and the stigma associated with breastmilk and breastfeeding. The hackathon aims to address these issues and develop solutions that make the breast pump more user-friendly, discreet, and data-rich.\n\nSome possible innovations include smarter interfaces and guided experiences, data collection, and hands-free compression bras. The hackathon is also seeking to impact policy by advocating for better access to private rooms for breast pumping during the workday.\n\nThe hackathon is open to the public, but registration is required. The event will take place at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn addition to the hackathon, there have been previous efforts to improve the breast pump, such as the Compress Express breast pump that mimics the natural art of hand expression and the Second Nature breast pump that mimics the way a baby suckles with massage and compression. These projects were showcased at the hackathon and are still accepting ideas for improvement.\n\nThe hackathon is part of a larger movement to address the challenges faced by working mothers and to bring attention to the importance of breastfeeding for both mother and baby.

However, he was not found on the plane, leading to speculation about his whereabouts. Reports suggest that Snowden may have been assisted by WikiLeaks, as Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, claimed to have been advising Snowden.\n\nThe U.S. government has expressed disappointment and frustration over the actions of Hong Kong and Russia in allowing Snowden to leave Hong Kong and potentially granting him asylum. John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, stated that it would be \"deeply troubling\" if these countries had adequate notice about Snowden's plans to flee and still allowed him to leave.\n\nThe situation has sparked a flurry of diplomatic activity, with the U.S. urging Russia to hand Snowden over for prosecution. Kerry asserted that the U.S. had returned seven criminals wanted by Russia in the past few years, but the U.S. has also irritated Russia by refusing to return Viktor Bout, a global arms smuggler.\n\nEcuador's Foreign Minister, Ricardo Patino, confirmed that Ecuador is considering Snowden's asylum request, citing freedom of expression and the security of citizens around the world as reasons for their consideration.

Some argue that the film's marketing may have been a factor, as it was overshadowed by Finding Dory and faced competition from other summer releases. The title, an acronym for Big Friendly Giant, may have also been confusing for some audiences. Additionally, the film lacked recognizable stars and the marketing budget was quite high, which could have contributed to its underperformance.\n\nDespite the disappointing box office results, critics generally praised the film's visual effects, special effects, and the performance of Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The attack was condemned by the Syrian government and its allies, Russia and Iran, but welcomed by the Syrian opposition and its supporters. The U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk missiles from two warships in the Mediterranean Sea, targeting the airstrips, hangars, control tower, and ammunition areas of the airbase. The strike was a response to the chemical attack, which was carried out from the same airbase. The Syrian military reported at least seven deaths, including a general and three soldiers. Russia condemned the U.S. move as aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law, while the U.S. called it a necessary response to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons. The strike was supported by several world leaders, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, but some Republican lawmakers questioned the constitutionality of the action. The strike also raised concerns about the potential for escalation and the impact on U.S.-Russia relations.

The portal provides counseling services to guide women through the process of using misoprostol, a drug that can cause a miscarriage, and answer questions in real-time. The counselors are trained by medical professionals and aim to connect women with abortion funds if payment is a barrier.\n\nThe project, titled Self-managed Abortion, Safe and Supported (SASS), is a response to the increasing number of US women who may be performing their own abortions due to limited access to clinics and high costs. Research suggests that many of these women are using misoprostol, a drug that can be purchased over the counter in Central American pharmacies, without proper medical supervision.\n\nThe legal implications of the project are unclear, as the act of looking for or giving out information about self-induced abortion is protected by law, but could potentially compound the legal risks for women who are charged with crimes related to self-induced abortion.\n\nIn a separate incident, a woman named Martina from Texas reached out to Women on Web, a Dutch not-for-profit group that mails abortion drugs to women in countries where abortion is outlawed. However, Women on Web does not send drugs to the US due to the country's restrictive abortion laws. Martina, who could not afford an abortion, turned to the internet for information on self-induced abortion and eventually traveled to Mexico to purchase misoprostol.\n\nIn the US, abortion is legal in every state, but laws require that abortion pills be administered by licensed health care clinicians. Using abortion pills obtained without a clinician can result in arrest. The World Health Organization considers misoprostol a safe and effective method for self-administered abortion when used within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe news highlights the ongoing struggle for reproductive rights in the US, particularly in light of the Trump administration's stance on abortion. The stories underscore the need for accessible and affordable abortion services for women, and the potential risks and challenges that women may face when seeking to terminate their pregnancies without proper guidance and support.", "answers": ["A Dutch organization that advises women on reproductive rights has now launched a website to help US women terminate pregnancies on their own. The Guardian reports on the \"Self-Managed Abortion: Safe and Supported\" portal, or SASS, set up by Women Help Women.

The medication, which, when taken alone or in combination with mifepristone, keeps a pregnancy from happening, is only legal in the US at medical facilities, though it can be purchased OTC in Central American nations. A Women Help Women rep says the idea for the site came about after a Guardian story documenting a Texas woman's trip to Mexico to get the drug, and all the questions she had once she got it. The site won't provide pills, and organizers say they won't even suggest women take them—they're just there to keep women safe if they've already decided to. \"It's worse to just remain silent,\" says a UC San Francisco obstetrics professor who calls misoprostol a \"very safe and effective\" drug (though it's more effective taken with mifepristone, which isn't as easy to obtain). For women who do have complications and must seek medical care, the Washington Post notes they'll be advised that drug-induced and spontaneous abortions typically look the same, and that the drug isn't detectable via drug test. Abortion foes note the meds can be dangerous if not taken correctly or if taken late in the gestation period, and that this site could put women at risk by providing info on taking them.

He encouraged other Republican candidates to consider dropping out to allow a positive, conservative message to rise to the top of the field and challenge front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nWalker's exit follows the departure of former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who also suspended his campaign earlier this month. With Walker's departure, the Republican field now stands at 15 candidates. The race has been marked by personal attacks and negative campaigning, with Trump as the current front-runner.\n\nWalker's campaign struggled to keep up with the financial demands of the race, despite raising $20 million for his super PAC in just two months. His campaign faced organizational issues and failed to mobilize grassroots support effectively. Walker's charisma-free Midwest persona was unable to compete with Trump's telegenic challenge to the party establishment.\n\nWalker's campaign was also hampered by strategic mistakes and self-inflicted wounds that raised questions about his readiness to serve as president. His poll numbers plummeted after the first GOP debate in early August, and he struggled to find a compelling national policy proposal. Walker's focus on labor battles in Wisconsin and his battles against public unions did not resonate with voters in the current political climate.\n\nWalker's decision to drop out was met with kind words from fellow Republican candidates, including Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Jeb Bush.

Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders.

Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border.

The author expresses concern that Clinton may be disconnected from the public mood and may struggle to provide answers to the issues that matter to voters.\n\nIn the second passage, it is argued that Clinton's chances of becoming the 45th president are roughly a 50/50 proposition, with the incumbency and Obama's approval rating being key factors. The economy, the Electoral College, and the \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" are also discussed, with the conclusion that Clinton's advantage in the Electoral College is small and may not hold up in a close election. The author also notes that the candidates' positions and ideologies may converge toward the center, and that Clinton is likely to be the Democratic nominee due to her political positions being similar to those of a \"generic Democrat.\"\n\nIn the third passage, it is argued that Clinton is a presumptive favorite to win the presidential election, with the Emerging Democratic Majority being considered real and young voters not turning toward the Republican Party. Clinton's unpopularity is also questioned, with the argument that she is not as unpopular as Republicans and that the email scandal may not have a significant impact on her electability. The author also notes that Obama's approval rating is trending upwards and that a strong economy could further boost Clinton's chances. The possibility of voter exhaustion with the Democratic Party is also discussed, but it is suggested that the partisan split may be too deeply entrenched for this to be a significant factor.

The unmasked names were then shared with various officials at the National Security Council, the Defense Department, and other intelligence agencies. The surveillance was part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and President-elect Donald Trump, as well as his associates, for up to a year before he took office. The unmasking of these names was not standard practice, as Americans are usually protected from incidental collection. The revelation has sparked controversy, with some arguing that the unmasking was politically motivated, while others maintain that it was within the law.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been investigating the matter, and it has been reported that he knew about the unmasking and leaking of these names back in January. Nunes has faced criticism for viewing pertinent documents on White House grounds and announcing their contents to the press.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends.

{"pred": "The Latter-day Saints, also known as Mormons, believe in the practice of plural marriage, which was instituted by revelation to Joseph Smith in the early 1840s. This practice, foreign to Western cultures, was seen as a commandment from God to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant and to create a sense of cohesion among the Latter-day Saints. Plural marriage resulted in large families and helped unite a diverse immigrant population. However, it was also met with opposition and was illegal in the United States from 1862.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced incrementally and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. The historical record of early plural marriage is thin due to the lack of records and the passage of time. The revelation on plural marriage was part of a larger revelation about eternal marriage, which was essential for inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children.\n\nJoseph Smith, the founder of the Latter-day Saints, married multiple wives and authorized others to do the same. He was motivated by religious reasons, the hope of living in God's presence with family, and the promise of eternal life. The exact number of women to whom Joseph was sealed is unknown, but most were between 20 and 40 years old at the time.\n\nPlural marriage was difficult for all involved, especially for Joseph's wife Emma. Emma approved of some of Joseph's plural marriages but opposed others. After Emma's denial of the practice, Joseph was placed in an agonizing dilemma between the will of God and the will of his wife.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage continued in Utah until 1890, when Church President Wilford Woodruff issued a statement declaring his intention to submit to the laws of the United States and discontinue the practice. The end of plural marriage was gradual and incremental, with some exceptions made until 1904.\n\nToday, the Latter-day Saints no longer practice plural marriage. They permit a man to be sealed to another woman after his wife has died, and they perform ordinances on behalf of deceased individuals who were married more than once. The Church acknowledges the contributions of scholars to the historical content presented and encourages members to trust in a wise Heavenly Father.", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The studies, published in PLOS One and PLoS ONE, suggest that these men use aggression as a means to maintain their social status and dominance, while higher-skilled men tend to be more supportive towards women.\n\nThe first study, led by Michael Kasumovic and Jeffrey Kuznekoff, observed the behavior of male gamers playing Halo 3, a popular first-person shooter game. The researchers found that lower-skilled players were more likely to make nasty comments towards female gamers, while higher-skilled players paid compliments to both male and female players. The study also noted that these patterns held true regardless of the outcome of the game or the player's individual performance.\n\nThe second study, led by Kasumovic and Kuznekoff again, delved deeper into the factors influencing this behavior. They hypothesized that poor performance and lower status among male players would increase their hostility towards female teammates, and that higher-skilled players would behave more positively towards women. The results supported this hypothesis, with lower-skilled players being more hostile towards a female-voiced player, especially when their own performance was poor. Conversely, higher-skilled players were more positive towards a female-voiced player.\n\nBoth studies suggest that the influx of female participants into male-dominated spaces can disrupt existing social hierarchies, causing insecurity and aggression among lower-status males.

As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

This finding challenges the notion that only humans use such brain asymmetry for sound processing.

The service, which is currently in a pilot phase, requires customers to have access to the Internet and an Internet interface program called Mosaic. Customers can view a customized menu for pizza and beverage options, enter their vital statistics, and place their orders. The orders are transmitted to Pizza Hut headquarters in Wichita, Kansas, and then relayed to the nearest Pizza Hut for delivery. To minimize risks of digital pranksters, the local restaurant verifies orders by phone. The service is considered simple and easy to execute, with minimal costs as Pizza Hut had already done much of the necessary software development.

The evidence includes a blog post from August 2008 mentioning a cryptocurrency paper, a PGP public key linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, and a post from January 10, 2009, mentioning the beta launch of Bitcoin. Wright's connection to Bitcoin is further supported by a leaked email discussing a tax dispute with the Australian government, where he considers using Nakamoto's identity to influence a senator.\n\nHowever, the Australian Federal Police raided Wright's home in Sydney for a tax investigation, stating that it had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. The Australian Taxation Office also declined to comment on Wright's tax affairs. Wright himself has not commented on these reports, and efforts to reach him were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2014, a Newsweek investigation incorrectly identified Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the creator of Bitcoin, but he denied any involvement.

The news reports highlight the immediate humanitarian response to the disaster, the potential long-term political and economic challenges in funding recovery efforts, and the scientific debate on the impact of climate change on the severity and frequency of extreme weather events.\n\n1. The immediate response to Hurricane Harvey showcased acts of community solidarity and selflessness, as ordinary people organized makeshift flotillas to rescue families trapped in the floodwaters. However, the recovery process may strain the nation's ability to coalesce as a unified community due to political divisions, as funding debates over the cost of recovery and the role of climate change in intensifying such disasters may challenge the nation's capacity to forge a common national direction.\n\n2. The cost of damages from Hurricane Harvey is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and the recovery process may be complicated by partisan divides and regional conflicts over funding offsets. The history of funding fights over previous disasters like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy indicates that Congressional conservatives, including those from Texas, may insist on offsetting aid with spending cuts elsewhere, which could prolong the debate and exacerbate regional tensions.\n\n3. The news reports also discuss the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of catastrophic storms like Hurricane Harvey. Scientists agree that warmer air and water mean wetter and potentially more intense hurricanes in the future. While it is too early to definitively attribute Harvey to climate change, scientists warn that such extreme weather events may become more common as the climate continues to warm.\n\n4. The news also highlights the need for a serious, informed debate on the policy implications of climate change, including the kind of infrastructure we build, the energy we rely upon, and the need for adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events. The reports call for a shift away from short-term, politically motivated responses to disasters and towards a long-term, comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of climate change and its impacts on society.\n\n5.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map.

That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The new testing will be conducted with more sensitive kits required by the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, which could potentially identify multiple contributors to DNA samples found on JonBenet's clothing.\n\nThe DNA evidence in question includes samples from JonBenet's panties and long johns, which were previously tested by a forensic laboratory in Virginia at the request of former District Attorney Mary Lacy. Lacy's conclusions regarding the DNA evidence have been disputed by multiple forensic experts who examined the evidence on behalf of 9NEWS and the Camera. These experts determined that male DNA found on the long johns and panties contained genetic material from at least two people in addition to JonBenet, and suggested that the DNA profile entered into the FBI's CODIS database in 2003 may not be an individual profile but a conglomeration of genetic material from multiple people.\n\nLacy's approach to the DNA evidence has been criticized for showing signs of confirmation bias, an investigation tainted by a desire to reach a hoped-for result.

The investigation, based on leaked documents and interviews with gambling and match-fixing experts, reveals that a core group of 16 players, including Grand Slam winners, have been repeatedly flagged for suspicious betting activity over the past decade. Despite this, none of these players have faced any sanctions from the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), which was set up to enforce fair play in tennis.\n\nThe evidence presented in the documents includes detailed evidence of suspected match-fixing orchestrated by gambling syndicates in Russia and Italy, which was uncovered in a 2008 probe but was shelved by tennis authorities. The investigation found that these syndicates made hundreds of thousands of pounds betting on matches they believed were fixed, and that at least 28 players were implicated in the fixing. However, the TIU took no action against any of these players.\n\nThe TIU has stated that it has a zero-tolerance approach to betting-related corruption, but Chris Kermode, the president of the Association of Tennis Professionals, has acknowledged that match-fixing is a problem in tennis. He has promised to investigate any new information that comes to light.\n\nThe documents also reveal that several players have been repeatedly flagged to the TIU over the past decade for involvement in suspicious matches, but none of them have been disciplined. The TIU has been warned about at least nine of these players since the 2008 probe, but none of them have been sanctioned.\n\n\nThe investigation was sparked by a 2007 probe into a match between Nikolay Davydenko and Martin Vassallo Arguello, which attracted heavily skewed betting and was later found to have been fixed. Both players were cleared of any wrongdoing, but the probe developed into a wider enquiry into a web of gamblers linked to top-level players.\n\nThe TIU has been criticized for its lack of transparency and its failure to act on evidence of match-fixing.

Among the accusations: Corrupt gamblers have contacted players in their hotels and offered them $50,000 or more to fix a match. Gambling syndicates in Russia and Italy then placed \"highly suspicious bets on scores of matches—including at Wimbledon and the French Open,\" says Buzzfeed.

{"pred": "A military coup attempt occurred in Turkey on July 15, 2016, led by a faction within the military that was believed to be linked to the Gülen movement, a moderate Sunni Islamic group led by Fethullah Gülen. The coup attempt was met with strong resistance from civilians and government supporters, resulting in a violent night of explosions, air battles, and gunfire that left at least 161 people dead and over 1,400 injured. The coup attempt was ultimately quashed, and the government began a purge of the military, detaining over 1,500 military personnel, including senior officers.\n\nThe Gülen movement, which has millions of followers in Turkey and around the world, has been a controversial group in Turkish politics for years. The movement is known for its schools, which are ubiquitous in Turkey but have also spread abroad, including to the United States, where they run over 100 charter schools. The movement emphasizes math and science education and avoids proselytizing, but has been the subject of scrutiny and criticism, particularly from anti-Islam groups and government agencies over evidence of mismanagement and allegations of misuse of funds.\n\nThe movement has a complex history with Turkish politics, with Gülen initially being a supporter of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan until they had a falling-out in 2013. Since then, the movement has been a target of the Turkish government, which has accused the movement of attempting to overthrow the government during the coup attempt. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and the movement has denied any involvement in the coup.\n\nIn response to the coup attempt, the Turkish government has requested the extradition of Gülen from the United States, where he lives in exile, but the Obama administration has steadfastly maintained that there is not enough evidence to support the extradition request. The Turkish government has also launched a crackdown on the judiciary, detaining nearly 3,000 prosecutors and judges over suspected links to the Gülen movement.\n\nThe aftermath of the coup attempt has seen a consolidation of power behind President Erdoğan and a further targeting of the Gülen movement.

Edelman. CNN reports on how many civilian supporters of Erdogan stood up to the coup attempt, in some cases blocking military vehicles with their cars and even lying down in front of tanks. Almost 3,000 military service members have been arrested and almost the same number of judges have been removed from their duties in what appears to be a nationwide purge of Gulen supporters, the Guardian reports. Reuters reports that Erdogan, who had been vacationing on the country's southeast coast, addressed thousands of supporters after flying into Ankara's airport early Saturday. \" This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army,\" he said.

However, a recent investigation by Politico has revealed that many of the individuals released were not merely sanctions violators but posed threats to national security. Some were part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics, which could be used in surface-to-air and cruise missiles, and other military and satellite technology. One individual was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology and hardware. The Obama administration also dropped charges and international arrest warrants for 14 other Iranian fugitives, some of whom were allegedly involved in procuring U.S. military antennas for IEDs that killed U.S. military personnel in Iraq, and leasing Boeing aircraft for an Iranian airline linked to Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.\n\nThe investigation found that the Obama administration had downplayed the threats posed by the men it let off, and even undermined its own counterproliferation efforts. The administration allegedly pressured federal prosecutors to slow-walk investigations into Iranian procurement efforts and sanctions violations, and some prosecutors were \"shocked and angry\" over the deal. The administration also denied requests to lure key Iranian targets to friendly countries for arrest, and delayed extradition requests for suspects already in custody overseas.\n\nThe investigation has raised concerns about the disclosure of sensitive information and the impact on ongoing investigations.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department.

Welsh spent much of Thursday morning on Twitter retweeting posts that trashed Dylan's win, and tweeting: \"I'm a Dylan fan, but this is an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.\" His main beef appears to be the separation of a metaphorical church and state—in this case, songs and lit—that he thinks should exist, adding, \"If you're a 'music' fan, look it up in the dictionary.

His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported.

Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News.

The hearings will be held in a makeshift setting on the sixth floor of an unmarked federal office building in downtown D.C., and will be the highest-profile opportunity for Democrats to criticize the president-elect. The nominees are being coached to answer questions without criticizing Trump, and are being advised to focus on working with Congress.\n\nThe second news passage discusses the rise of Jared Kushner, the husband of Ivanka Trump, who has become a key player in the Trump administration. Kushner, who was previously a socially-minded real estate developer and newspaper publisher, has emerged as a trusted adviser to Trump and is expected to play a major role in the White House. He has been credited with helping Trump win the election, and has been involved in recruiting top talent for the administration. Kushner has been described as a bridge between Trump and the traditional Republican establishment, and has been credited with helping to moderate some of Trump's more extreme positions.\n\nThe third news passage discusses the hiring of Campbell Brown, a former NBC News star, by Facebook to head news partnerships. Facebook is looking to develop stronger ties with publishers, and is planning to announce further announcements in this area soon. The hiring of Brown is seen as a sign that Facebook is taking a more deliberate approach to its relationship with the news industry.\n\nThe fourth news passage reports that President Obama held a farewell bash for alumni, celebrities, and donors at the White House. The event was attended by many prominent figures, including Bruce Springsteen, Meryl Streep, and David Remnick. The event was seen as a symbolic end to the Obama era, and many attendees expressed sadness that they may not return to the White House for several years.\n\nThe fifth news passage discusses the Detroit Auto Show, which will feature new electric models from Aston Martin and Lamborghini, as well as a battery-powered take on the Volkswagen I.D. Microbus. The Ford F-150 was named the best-selling vehicle for the 35th consecutive year.\n\nThe sixth news passage discusses the release of Uber data", "answers": ["Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner is expected to end up with an influential White House role, and pundit Mike Allen's new Axios newsletter says lawyers have figured out a way around nepotism rules that will result in a title as \"senior adviser.\" The latest cover of New York magazine has a different title: \"President In-Law.\" The story provides perhaps the most in-depth look so far at Ivanka Trump's 35-year-old husband, and it throws a bit of cold water on the notion that Kushner will act as a \"force for moderation\" on the new president's most controversial ideas. While Kushner has become one of Trump's most trusted advisers, \"there’s little evidence that anyone can moderate Trump, other than Trump himself, and there is little doubt where Kushner’s ultimate loyalties lie,\" writes Andrew Rice. As Kushner himself has put it: \"family first.\" The story details what seems to have been a profound change in Kushner over the past year, as he surprised those in New York's elite circles who knew him, or thought they knew him, by embracing his father-in-law's campaign so strongly. \"Some of the same Manhattan liberals who ostracized [Kushner] during the campaign were rattled afterward, and they sent him emails, trying to offer healing words of congratulations and conciliation,\" writes Rice. \"These went right in the trash.\" And while Kushner is described as soft-spoken, that is true only in the most literal sense: His voice is, in fact, soft, but Kushner himself is described as aggressive and driven. In fact, he \"is more like father-in-law than anyone imagines,\" declares the piece. Read it in full here."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9611}
{"pred": "Researchers have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to enable communication for individuals suffering from complete locked-in state (CLIS) due to advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The system works by detecting changes in brain activity associated with \"yes\" or \"no\" thoughts, allowing patients to answer personal and open questions. The study involved four ALS patients, two of whom were permanently in CLIS and two entering CLIS without reliable means of communication. Three patients completed over 40 sessions, and one patient completed 20 sessions. The fNIRS-based BCI was successful in training patients to regulate their frontocentral brain regions in response to questions, and online fNIRS classification of personal questions and open questions resulted in over 70% correct responses. The study's positive results could potentially pave the way for abolishing complete locked-in states for ALS patients.\n\nThe research was funded by various grants, including the German Ministry of Education and Research, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, and the European Union. The work was also supported by regular salary from San Camillo hospital in Venice, Italy, and the intramural research program of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe study aimed to provide at least some means of communication for patients in CLIS, as existing techniques, such as P300 event-related potential, sensory motor rhythm BCI, and invasive electrocorticogram recordings, have not been successful in providing reliable and meaningful communication with BCI. The researchers argued that communication does not necessarily mean expressing feelings, thoughts, and intentions in a fluent, automatized manner but rather conveying one's intent or feelings and thoughts in response to questions.\n\nThe researchers used fNIRS-based BCI to train patients to regulate their brain activity in response to questions. The system was successful in training patients, and online fNIRS classification of personal questions and open questions resulted in above-chance-level correct responses. The study found that lower frequencies in the theta-frequency band correlated with inferior communication performance, possibly due to decreased vigilance and attention.\n\nThe study's positive results could potentially revolutionize communication", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system. And it turns out that one of them really didn't want his daughter to marry her boyfriend. The patients all had advanced ALS and were unable to control even their eyes, reports the Guardian. In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 9424}

{"pred": "President Donald Trump unveiled his first budget proposal, titled \"America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again,\" on March 16, 2017. The budget aims to increase defense spending by $54 billion and offset this increase by stripping funds from more than 18 other agencies. The proposed budget would result in a 25% reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), eliminating 50 programs and 3,200 positions. It would also eliminate federal support for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The budget would cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by $5.8 billion, despite Trump's promises to find cures for diseases. The budget would also eliminate Amtrak's long-distance train services and subsidies for rural air service.\n\nThe budget would increase spending for the Department of Defense by 10%, with a focus on troop readiness, the fight against Islamic State militants, and procurement of new ships, fighter jets, and other weapons. The budget would also allocate $1.5 billion for the border wall in the ongoing fiscal year and $2.6 billion in the 2018 budget year, with the expectation that Mexico would eventually pay for the wall.\n\nThe budget would also make significant cuts to foreign aid, with the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development facing a 28% reduction. The budget would also eliminate funding for the United Nations' Green Climate Fund and slash funding for climate, ocean, and earth science programs at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe budget would also eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, legal aid for the poor, low-income heating assistance, and the AmeriCorps national service program.

The proposal—titled \"America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again\"—contains cuts that the Washington Post says could be the biggest reduction in federal programs since the post-World War II drawdown. The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%. Military spending would be beefed up by $54 billion under the proposal, $1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and Homeland Security would get a 6.8% funding increase. A roundup of coverage about the $1.15 trillion spending plan: The document is here. Politico reports that the budget is \"red meat\" for Trump's base, with deep cuts to their most disliked government agencies and programs, though it is also what's known as a \"skinny budget\" because it is so short on details. A more detailed budget will be out in May. The AP lists winners and losers. The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday. He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,\" Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters. \"We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets.\" The Hill notes that such proposals tend to be \"little more than guidance\" for lawmakers—and that the Senate shot down Obama's 2015 budget 98 to 1. The AP reports that the budget funds Trump's boost for the Pentagon, the biggest since Ronald Reagan's, with cuts to conservative targets including the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, and the AmeriCorps national service program. NBC notes that Trump's proposal, which makes cuts to 12 out of 15 Cabinet agencies, only covers the \"discretionary\" quarter of the $4 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in October. The portion dealing with issues including taxation, Social Security, and Medicare is due in mid-May. The Washington Post reports that the budget proposal's elimination of funding for public broadcasting means that Big Bird's doom has been predicted once again, though public broadcasting has survived previous \"zero funding\" proposals all the way back to Richard Nixon."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9576}
