{"pred": "Scott Sears, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles and the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray, has achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo and unsupported. Sears embarked on a 702-mile trek through the Antarctic, pulling a sled filled with supplies for 38 days, braving 150mph winds and temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius. His journey ended on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records is yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books. The journey, which began from Hercules Inlet where sea ice meets land, is considered dangerous due to the presence of crevasses. Sears, who is not roped to a teammate for safety, had to navigate these treacherous areas using skis.\n\nSears encountered a challenging phase during the final leg of his journey, hitting a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve. However, after refueling with food and music, he managed to push through and complete his journey. On Christmas Day, he reached the South Pole in blue skies, expressing his joy in a blog post.\n\nSears' expedition was not just a personal achievement but also a charitable endeavor. He raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which were destroyed in the 2015 earthquake.\n\nSears' accomplishment has been widely recognized and celebrated. Judy Murray, Andy Murray's mother, congratulated him on Twitter. He is expected to take a few weeks to process his experience before returning to normal life, expressing his eagerness for a shower and food.", "answers": ["While many people were unwrapping gifts on Christmas Day, the brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray was wrapping up a 700-mile, 38-day journey through brutally cold temps and blistering winds—and, he hopes, setting a world record. Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.
