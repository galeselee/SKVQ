Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest.

{"pred": "In a series of studies, researchers have discovered a paradoxical trade-off in the antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. These proteins, which prevent freezing by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals, also inhibit melting, leading to the potential accumulation of ice in the fish's bodies.\n\nIn a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of scientists found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP) both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples, solutions of purified AFPs, and in live fishes. This superheated ice persisted inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 hours, and at a lower temperature for at least several days.\n\nField experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild notothenioid fishes. However, over a long-term temperature record (1999–2012) from a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, it was found that summer warming did not reliably eliminate internal ice due to the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal, revealed that the ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely exceed the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes, meaning these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives. This could potentially cause life-threatening traffic jams inside small capillaries, but it could also help them stay cool under pressure.\n\nThe long-term cost of this life-saving protein is a question for further research, as it remains unknown whether there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies. The highest concentration of ice crystals was found in the fishes' spleens, suggesting that this organ may be trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThese findings provide a better understanding of the progression of all species and the potential unintended consequences of evolutionary innovations. The researchers emphasize that evolution is a stepwise", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

The women were convicted on charges related to the October 31 protest in Alexandria. Among them were seven teenagers aged 15 and 16, who were sentenced to prison terms until they turn 18. The harshness of the sentences and the scenes of police brutality a day earlier were seen as signs that the military-backed government is becoming more authoritarian, reminiscent of the Hosni Mubarak era.\n\nThe crackdown is not limited to Islamist supporters of Morsi, as secular youth activists have also been targeted. On November 26, police broke up two small protests by secular activists in Cairo, beating and detaining women protesters. The government has justified its actions as necessary to fight terrorism and maintain stability, while critics argue that it is silencing dissent and widening the base of the opposition.\n\nThe new protest law banning any protests or public political gatherings of more than 10 people without a prior police permit has been a major point of contention.
