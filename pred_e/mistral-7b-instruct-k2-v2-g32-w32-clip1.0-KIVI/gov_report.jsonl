{"pred": "The report, titled \"Understanding and Managing Information Technology Supply Chain Risks in Federal Agencies,\" highlights the complexity of information system design and development, particularly the intricate global supply chains involved. These supply chains can be long, complex, and distributed across multiple countries, making it challenging for federal agencies to have visibility, understanding, or control over the technology they acquire. The report emphasizes that federal agencies rely heavily on IT equipment manufactured in foreign nations, with many components having potential origins in various countries.\n\nThe report discusses the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, which requires federal agencies to develop and implement an agency-wide information security program. It also mentions several guidelines and requirements issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to help federal agencies manage information and communications technology supply chain risks.\n\nThe report identifies several potential threats to federal agencies' information systems, including the installation of hardware or software containing malicious logic, counterfeit hardware or software, failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products, reliance on a malicious or unqualified service provider, and installation of hardware or software with unintentional vulnerabilities.\n\nThe report notes that while some national security-related agencies have made progress in addressing supply chain risks, others have made limited progress. It makes several recommendations to improve the management of IT supply chain risks, including developing and documenting departmental policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities. The agencies generally agreed with these recommendations, and most have implemented them to some extent.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the importance of federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring IT supply chain risks as part of their information security programs, as the global IT supply chain introduces numerous security risks that could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems.", "answers": ["IT systems are essential to the operations of the federal government. The supply chain—the set of organizations, people, activities, and resources that create and move a product from suppliers to end users—for IT systems is complex and global in scope. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IT supply chain is a continuing threat. Federal security guidelines provide for managing the risks to the supply chain. This testimony statement highlights information security risks associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT systems. The statement also summarizes GAO's 2012 report that assessed the extent to which four national security-related agencies had addressed such risks. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previous reports, as well as information provided by the national security-related agencies on their actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations. GAO also reviewed federal information security guidelines and directives. Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal information systems. Supply chain threats are present during the various phases of an information system's development life cycle and could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies. Information technology (IT) supply chain-related threats are varied and can include: installation of intentionally harmful hardware or software (i.e., containing “malicious logic”); installation of counterfeit hardware or software; failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products; reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers for the performance of technical services; and installation of hardware or software containing unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defective code. These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of materials needed to develop systems. These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include the acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; inadequate testing of software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain. GAO reported in 2012 that the four national security-related agencies in its review—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. Of the four agencies, Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. It had defined and implemented supply chain protection controls, and initiated efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Conversely, Energy and DHS had not developed or documented policies and procedures that defined security measures for protecting against IT supply chain threats and had not developed capabilities for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. Although Justice had defined supply chain protection measures, it also had not developed or documented procedures for implementing or monitoring the measures. Energy and Justice fully implemented the recommendations that GAO made in its 2012 report and resolved the deficiencies that GAO had identified with their supply chain risk management efforts by 2016. DHS also fully implemented two recommendations to document policies and procedures for defining and implementing security measures to protect against supply chain threats by 2015, but could not demonstrate that it had fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to assess the effectiveness of the security measures. In its 2012 report, GAO recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The departments generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3092}

However, only 117 of these potential FBOs self-certified as exempt from religious-based hiring restrictions, with 9 of them being awarded DOJ grants.\n\nThe Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within HHS, was the only grant program where nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients and no grants were awarded to FBOs.\n\nThe report also highlights that the Departments varied in their methods for providing information about religious-based hiring restrictions and exemption options to grantees. For example, DOJ made this information available on agency web pages and through grant announcements, while DOL and HHS provided it through web pages and grant application forms.\n\nThe report also interviewed several FBOs that received funding but did not self-certify as exempt, finding that some were unaware of the exemption option or did not consider religion in their hiring decisions.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that the Departments require grantees seeking exemptions from religious-based hiring restrictions to self-certify, but the review and approval processes for these requests vary across the departments. The report recommends that the Departments improve their communication of exemption options to grantees and consider implementing a standardized process for reviewing and approving exemption requests.", "answers": ["The federal government provides billions of dollars in grant funding to organizations offering social services, including FBOs. In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring. GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption. GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites. All three agencies require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions. For example, DOJ, DOL, and HHS have policies requiring grantees to submit their exemption self-certification, but only DOL reviews exemption requests and either approves them or provides a reason for denial."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2968}

{"pred": "The report, compiled by a government agency, focuses on the seizures of potentially harmful items by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) between 2012 and 2016. The report reveals that CBP conducted approximately 308,000 seizures of items that could pose threats to U.S. security, health, safety, business, and ecology. The majority of these seizures, about 70 percent, were made from international mail, while the remaining 30 percent were from express cargo. The seized items are categorized as either drugs or merchandise, with illegal or inadmissible drugs accounting for about 47 percent of total seizures and merchandise accounting for about 53 percent.\n\nThe report also highlights an increase in fentanyl-related deaths, leading to a heightened focus on fentanyl trafficking. While CBP's seizure data shows no fentanyl seizures between 2012 and 2015, a specific category for fentanyl was added to the Seized Asset and Case Tracking System (SEACATS) in 2016, reflecting 53 seizures of fentanyl in that year.\n\nThe report discusses the challenges faced by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in providing EAD (Electronic Advance Data) for inbound international mail, which is crucial for CBP to inspect and analyze. USPS received EAD for about half of all inbound international mail in March 2017, up from about a third for the period from April 2016 to March 2017.\n\nTwo pilot programs were initiated in 2014 and 2015 at the New York International Service Center to target certain mail for inspection using EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. However, the report notes that USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection due to challenges in locating the items within large sacks of mail.\n\nThe report recommends that CBP, in conjunction with USPS, establish measurable performance goals for these pilots, assess the performance of the pilots in achieving these goals, and evaluate the costs and benefits of using EAD for targeting mail for inspection compared to other methods. The Department of Homeland Security", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes information contained in GAO's August 2017 report, entitled International Mail Security: Costs and Benefits of Using Electronic Data to Screen Mail Need to Be Assessed ( GAO-17-606 ). U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary federal agency tasked with targeting and inspecting inbound international items and seizing illegal goods, including illegal or inadmissible drugs and merchandise. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and express consignment operators (such as FedEx and DHL) provide items to CBP for inspection. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with electronic advance data (EAD), such as the shipper's and recipient's name and address, for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement. In 2014 and 2015, USPS and CBP initiated two pilot programs at the New York International Service Center (ISC) to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. Under the pilots, CBP uses EAD to target a small number of pieces of mail each day. According to USPS officials, when USPS employees scan either individual targeted pieces or larger sacks containing this targeted mail, they are alerted that CBP has targeted the item and set the item or sack aside for inspection. According to USPS and CBP, USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection because locating targeted mail once it arrives at an ISC has been a challenge. Since the pilots began, USPS has provided CBP with about 82 percent of targeted mail for one pilot, and about 58 percent of targeted mail for the other. However, while USPS and CBP have collected some performance information for these pilots (including the percentage of targeted mail provided for inspection), this information is not linked to a specific performance target agreed upon by USPS and CBP--such as a specific percentage of targeted mail provided to CBP for inspection. Further, the agencies have not conducted an analysis to determine if the pilot programs are achieving desired outcomes. Because CBP and USPS lack clear performance goals for these pilots, they risk spending additional time and resources expanding them prior to fully assessing the pilots' success or failure. In our report we found that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing time and resources needed for the screening process--potentially decreasing costs--and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. For example, CBP has collected data on the percentage of inspections resulting in a seizure for mail inspected as a result of targeting in the pilot programs at the New York ISC. However, CBP does not collect comparable data for seizures resulting from inspections conducted based on current methods of choosing mail for inspection. In light of the challenges that collecting and using these data present, it is important that CBP and USPS carefully consider actions to enhance inbound international mail security to avoid wasting time and money on potentially ineffective and costly endeavors. In our report, we recommended that CBP, in coordination with USPS: (1) establish measureable performance goals to assess pilot programs and (2) evaluate the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection compared with other targeting methods. CBP and USPS agreed with these recommendations and CBP plans to implement them by February 28, 2018."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2565}

The program's funding and benefit structure are designed to counteract economic fluctuations, with increased tax revenues during economic growth and decreased spending on benefits, creating a surplus or reserve fund. During recessions, UC tax revenue falls, and spending rises, leading to potential insufficient funds for benefit payments. In such cases, states may opt for federal loans to meet their UC obligations, which they are required to repay with interest.\n\nThe report highlights that states have significant autonomy in managing their UC programs but must adhere to federal guidelines for prompt payment of benefits. If a state's trust fund account is depleted, it may borrow funds from the federal Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) or outside sources. If borrowing from the UTF, the state must repay the loan, plus interest, within a few years, or face increased federal taxes for employers.\n\nThe report also explains the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) within the UTF, primarily funded by excess revenue from the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA) and loans from the U.S. Treasury.

In March 2015, the GAO recommended that the FCC conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals.\n\nThe report raises concerns about the accuracy of Lifeline enrollment data, as the FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline benefits also have non-Lifeline phone service.

This testimony is based on GAO's May 2017 report and discusses steps FCC has taken to measure Lifeline's performance in meeting goals; steps FCC and USAC have taken to enhance controls over finances, subscribers, and providers; and any weaknesses that might remain. For the May 2017 report, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from FCC and USAC. GAO also analyzed subscriber data from 2014 and performed undercover tests to identify potential improper payment vulnerabilities. The results of this analysis and testing are illustrative, not generalizable. In its May 2017 report, GAO found the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated the Lifeline program's (Lifeline) performance in meeting its goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income households by providing financial support, but it has recently taken steps to begin to do so. FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized.

Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. In its May 2017 report, GAO made seven recommendations, including that FCC ensure plans to transfer the USF from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented expeditiously. FCC generally agreed with all the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3955}
{"pred": "This report, compiled by an unspecified government agency, examines the use of tax incentives to promote energy production and investment in various resources. Since the 1970s, policymakers have employed tax codes to advance energy policy objectives such as securing energy supply, reducing costs, and aligning energy production with environmental goals. The report focuses on tax incentives that support energy production and investment, revealing that until the mid-2000s, the majority of revenue losses associated with these incentives were from provisions benefiting fossil fuels. However, the balance has since shifted, with the bulk of current federal revenue losses stemming from incentives for renewable energy production and investment. Despite the growth in renewable energy production, fossil fuels continue to account for the majority of domestic energy production.\n\nThe report acknowledges several limitations, including the fact that current-year tax incentives may not directly support current-year energy production, and that varying levels of federal financial support may not necessarily reflect underlying policy rationales. Additionally, the analysis does not account for federal spending on energy that is not linked to the tax code.\n\nThe report presents data on U.S. primary energy production in 2017, revealing that fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of production, with natural gas being the largest source at 32.0%, followed by crude oil at 22.1% and coal at 17.7%. Renewable energy sources accounted for 12.8% of production, with biomass being the largest renewable contributor at 5.9%.\n\nIn 2017, the tax code provided an estimated $17.8 billion in support for the energy sector, with more than one-third of this support, $6.4 billion, coming from the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC). Fossil fuels received an estimated $4.6 billion in support, a figure that declined to $3.2 billion in 2018 due to changes in the tax legislation enacted in 2017.\n\nThe report concludes that the distribution of tax-related federal financial support for energy differs across sectors and is not necessarily proportional to the amount of energy production from various sectors. The total amount of energy-related tax incentives is projected to decline under current law", "answers": ["The U.S. tax code supports the energy sector by providing a number of targeted tax incentives, or tax incentives available only for the energy industry. Some policymakers have expressed interest in understanding how energy tax benefits are distributed across different domestic energy resources. For example, what percentage of energy-related tax benefits support fossil fuels (or support renewables)? How much domestic energy is produced using fossil fuels (or produced using renewables)? And how do these figures compare? In 2017, the value of federal tax-related support for the energy sector was estimated to be $17.8 billion. Of this, $4.6 billion (25.8%) can be attributed to tax incentives supporting fossil fuels. Tax-related support for renewables was an estimated $11.6 billion in 2017 (or 65.2% of total tax-related support for energy). The remaining tax-related support went toward nuclear energy, efficiency measures, and alternative technology vehicles. While the cost of tax incentives for renewables has exceeded the cost of incentives for fossil fuels in recent years, the majority of energy produced in the United States continues to be derived from fossil fuels. In 2017, fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production. The remaining primary energy production is attributable to renewable energy and nuclear electric resources, with shares of 12.8% and 9.5%, respectively. The balance of energy-related tax incentives has changed over time, and it is projected to continue to change, under current law, in coming years. Factors that have contributed to recent changes in the balance of energy-related tax incentives include the following: Increased tax expenditures for solar and wind. Tax expenditures associated with the energy credit for solar and the production tax credit for wind have increased substantially in recent years. Following the long-term extensions of these temporary tax benefits provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), tax expenditures for the solar energy credit are projected to remain stable for several years, before decreasing in the longer term. The expiration of tax-related support for renewable fuels. Tax-related support for renewable fuels declined substantially after the tax credits for alcohol fuels were allowed to expire at the end of 2011. Other fuels-related incentives also expired at the end of 2017 (although these may be extended as part of the \"tax extenders\"). Decline then increase in tax expenditures for fossil fuels. Tax expenditures for fossil fuels declined between 2017 and 2018, an indirect effect of the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97). Over time, however, the tax expenditures associated with permanent fossil fuels tax incentives are estimated to increase. One starting point for evaluating energy tax policy may be a calculation of subsidy relative to production level. However, a complete policy analysis might consider why the level of federal financial support differs across various energy technologies. Tax incentives for energy may support various environmental or economic objectives. For example, tax incentives designed to reduce reliance on imported petroleum may be consistent with energy security goals. Tax incentives that promote renewable energy resources may be consistent with certain environmental objectives."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3582}

The Controlled Substances Act requires entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances to register with the DEA. The Disposal Act of 2010 allows the public to dispose of unused controlled substances at authorized entities, with DEA regulations outlining three methods: disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Eligible entities, such as pharmacies and hospitals, can become authorized collectors by modifying their DEA registration, with costs and training involved. DEA regulations detail requirements for disposal bin management, such as secure installation, proper signage, and regular destruction of inner liners. As of April 2017, 2.49% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins, with most being pharmacies and hospitals. However, participation rates varied significantly by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate and many states having less than 5% participation. Factors affecting participation include costs, uncertainty over regulations, and participation in other disposal programs. The report suggests that improving communication and addressing regulatory conflicts could increase participation. The report recommends that DEA identify cost-effective methods for communicating with stakeholders and resolve conflicts with other federal regulations to encourage more entities to become authorized collectors. The report also notes that about half of the U.S. population lives within 5 miles of a disposal bin, but availability varies significantly between urban and rural areas.", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3373}

The CNMI has a population of 53,890, with the majority residing on Saipan. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 established the CW program, which allows foreign workers to work in the CNMI for up to a year through their employers. The number of CW-1 permits is determined annually by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and has been capped since 2014. The proposed Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act (S. 2325) includes provisions that would affect the CW program, such as numerical caps on permits and a new CW-3 worker designation for eligible workers who were admitted as CW-1 workers before the enactment of S. 2325.\n\nThe CNMI's economy has been growing, with a significant increase in visitor spending and investment in construction, particularly the construction of a casino in Saipan. Visitor arrivals have nearly doubled since 2011, with a rise in arrivals from China and South Korea offsetting a decline in Japanese arrivals. Employment in the CNMI has also increased since 2014, with foreign workers making up the majority of the workforce. The number of CW-1 permits has been increasing, with a significant increase in petitions from 2012 to 2016.

DHS is required to decrease the number of permits issued annually, reducing them to zero by the end of the transition period, scheduled for December 31, 2019. To implement the law, DHS established a new work permit program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers can obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI. The law was amended in August 2017 to, among other things, restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations. Proposed legislation—Senate bill S. 2325—would, among other things, extend the transition period through December 31, 2029; increase the number of available permits from the 2018 level; and set required decreases in the annual numerical limit for the permits.

This testimony discusses (1) recent trends in the CNMI economy and (2) preliminary observations about the number of approved CW-1 permits and characteristics of permit holders, drawn from GAO's ongoing work. GAO updated information about the CNMI's economy that it reported in May 2017 (see GAO-17-437 ). GAO also analyzed data and documents from U.S. agencies and the CNMI government.

In 2016, the CNMI's GDP rose by 29 percent, partly as a result of construction investment. While tourism has fluctuated in recent years, visitor arrivals in the CNMI rose by nearly a third from 2016 to 2017. After nearly a decade of annual decline, the total number of workers employed in the CNMI increased from 2013 through 2016, according to the most recent available CNMI tax data. Foreign workers made up 53 percent of those employed in 2016, compared with roughly 75 percent in 2002. GAO's preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CNMI-Only Transitional Worker (CW-1) permits for foreign workers in the CNMI grew from over 7,100 for fiscal year 2012 to nearly 13,000 for fiscal year 2017. In addition, GAO identified trends in the country of birth, occupation, and employment duration of foreign workers with CW-1 permits approved for fiscal years 2012 through 2018.

{"pred": "The report discusses the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines for source selection procedures used by the Department of Defense (DOD) in procurement. The procedures range from the tradeoff procedure to Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures. DOD may use LPTA when the requirement is clearly defined, the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, and additional technical capabilities or past performance do not offer significant value. In such cases, DOD specifies minimum requirements in the solicitation, and the award is based on the lowest price.\n\nThe report highlights that DOD may use tradeoff procedures when the requirement is less definitive, more development work is required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these instances, non-cost factors can play a dominant role in the source selection process, and tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors are allowed.\n\nThe report also discusses DOD's increased use of LPTA procedures, particularly for commercial products or services, where risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, and there is no value in paying more for higher performance. However, the report notes that DOD rarely uses LPTA for IT and support services contracts, especially for complex requirements.\n\nThe report also mentions a 2017 law (Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act) that requires DOD to revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to ensure that LPTA procedures are used only when certain criteria are met. These criteria include the ability to describe minimum performance requirements objectively, the lack of value in proposals exceeding the solicitation's minimum technical requirements, the ability to evaluate proposals with little subjectivity, the certainty that a review of technical proposals would not identify factors providing additional benefits, the inclusion of a justification for using LPTA in the contract file, and the confirmation that the lowest price offered reflects full life-cycle costs.\n\nThe report concludes that while DOD officials generally assessed whether additional value would be gained from proposals exceeding the minimum technical requirements, they did not always document their justifications for choosing LPTA procedures and did not always confirm that the lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs.

When awarding a contract competitively, DOD may use the LPTA source selection process to select the lowest-priced offer that is technically acceptable. In contrast, DOD may use the trade-off source selection process to award a higher-priced contract to a firm if the firm's offer provides greater benefit and it is worth paying the additional cost. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 calls on DOD to avoid using the LPTA process for information technology, cybersecurity, and other knowledge-based professional support services. The Act also included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's use of LPTA procedures for contracts valued at more than $10 million. This report assesses the (1) extent to which DOD used LPTA procedures for certain services, and (2) factors that contracting officials considered when deciding to use LPTA procedures. GAO reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation to identify 781 contracts valued at $10 million or above awarded by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the first half of fiscal year 2017, the most recent period for which data were available. GAO then selected 133 of these contracts for information technology and support services, which include services reflected in the Act. GAO identified that 9 contracts used LPTA procedures and reviewed 7 of these, including interviewing officials and reviewing contract documents. DOD had no comments on the draft report. During the first half of fiscal year 2017, the Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures when awarding contracts valued at $10 million or more for the types of services identified by the National Defense Authorization Act, such as information technology services. Department of Defense (DOD) guidance states that LPTA procedures are typically for requirements that are well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services with a minimal risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The figure shows the military departments' limited use of LPTA procedures for contracts for selected services. For the 7 contracts that GAO reviewed, contracting officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. Contracting officials also stated that LPTA was used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For example, the Navy used LPTA procedures to award a contract for commercially available monthly telephone maintenance services. In addition, the Air Force used LPTA procedures to award a contract for mail sorting and delivery. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to amend its regulations to require contracting officers to consider specific criteria when deciding to use LPTA procedures. DOD has not yet revised its regulations to implement Section 813.

The Capitol Rotunda is primarily used for commemoration ceremonies, Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies, artwork unveilings, presidential inauguration activities, honoring individuals lying in state or honor, and prayer vigils. The Capitol Grounds are used for events sponsored by non-federal government groups, memorial services, federal government events, and award and dedication ceremonies. Emancipation Hall, located in the Capitol Visitor Center, is used for similar purposes as the Rotunda, including commemoration ceremonies, Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies, artwork unveilings, and presidential inauguration activities.\n\nThe report highlights that the use of these spaces requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate, except for events that can be issued permits by the U.S. Capitol Police. The search for concurrent resolutions was conducted using Congress.gov, and the results were categorized based on the type of event. The report includes tables and appendices that list the concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress for the use of the Capitol Rotunda, Capitol Grounds, and Emancipation Hall, along with the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution.\n\nThe report also mentions that the largest percentage of concurrent resolutions (34.3%) authorized the use of the Rotunda for commemoration ceremonies, often of historical events. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions for the Capitol Grounds (65.5%) authorized events sponsored by non-federal government groups. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions for Emancipation Hall (46.5%) authorized the use of the space for commemoration ceremonies.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that the use of these spaces is an important part of the legislative process and serves to honor various individuals, events, and achievements. The report also notes that the use of Emancipation Hall has increased since its opening in 2007.", "answers": ["The Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out under the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol. Ninety-nine concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Rotunda between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. Use of the Capitol Grounds can be authorized either by the passage of a concurrent resolution or through an application process with the Capitol Police. A concurrent resolution is typically needed for events longer than 24 hours in duration, for events that require vehicles on the Capitol Grounds for setup, for events requiring electronics on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, and for events where a large number of Members will be in attendance. The Capitol Police's special events office handles permits and approval for all other events. One hundred twelve concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into four categories: (1) events sponsored by nonfederal-government groups; (2) memorial services; (3) events sponsored by the federal government; and (4) award and dedication ceremonies. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. These resolutions can be divided into four categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies, (2) congressional gold medal ceremonies, (3) artwork unveilings, and (4) presidential inauguration activities.

{"pred": "The report provides an analysis of the Department of Defense's (DOD) strategy documents that guided the rebalancing of U.S. military efforts towards the Pacific region from 2012 to 2016. The rebalancing strategy was initiated by President Obama in 2011, with the aim of focusing more attention on the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to over half of the world's population, several large militaries, and five nations allied with the U.S. through mutual defense treaties or agreements. PACOM, one of six geographic combatant commands, is responsible for the Pacific region and is supported by four service component commands.\n\nThe report identifies six strategy documents issued between 2012 and 2015 as relevant and representative of DOD's previous strategy to implement the rebalance to the Pacific. These documents include Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership, Quadrennial Defense Review, National Military Strategy, Guidance for the Employment of the Force, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, and PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT). These documents collectively included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective strategy for the rebalance to the Pacific, but were found to be lacking in several key areas.\n\nThe report highlights two significant gaps: the lack of a consistent definition of the rebalance to the Pacific and the absence of a documented end state for the rebalance. The absence of a consistent definition makes it difficult for policy makers to assess the strategy's effectiveness and accountability, while the lack of a documented end state makes it unclear what the ultimate goal of the rebalance effort is. The report suggests that identifying a command-wide end state and a clear and consistent definition for the rebalance could help DOD better position itself to achieve its objectives in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that, in moving forward, considering the identification of strategic end states and the inclusion of the other missing elements could help DOD achieve its objectives in the Asia-Pacific region. The report provides a draft of the report to DOD for review, and copies are being sent to relevant congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, and other relevant officials", "answers": ["In 2011, President Obama announced that the United States would turn its attention to the Asia-Pacific region and make the U.S. presence there a top priority. Rebalancing to the Pacific became strategic guidance that informed military planning. By the end of 2015, DOD published strategy documents that included references to the rebalance to the Pacific or related concepts. In February 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs stated that while DOD continues to prioritize the Asia-Pacific region, the rebalance to the Pacific is no longer U.S. policy. DOD has published the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which establishes an objective of maintaining a favorable regional balance in the Pacific region, among other regions. Prior to the change in policy, House Report 114-102 included a provision for GAO to review matters related to the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that included desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO analyzed six DOD strategy documents that officials identified as providing guidance for the rebalance to the Pacific to determine whether, as a set, they included desired elements associated with an effective national strategy. DOD had no comments on this report. Department of Defense (DOD) strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. The U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), which is responsible for the Asia-Pacific region, used DOD strategy documents to implement the President's direction to rebalance to the Pacific, which generally refocused U.S. efforts to that region. PACOM officials told GAO that there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense ; Quadrennial Defense Review ; National Military Strategy ; Guidance for the Employment of the Force ; Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan ; and the PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) . Based on GAO's analysis, DOD's six strategy documents that guided the rebalance to the Pacific included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective national strategy. However, two key elements were missing from the group of strategy documents: (1) a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific, and (2) the identification of the overall results desired, or end state, for the rebalance. DOD officials also could not identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents or provide a definition that was used consistently across the department. According to a DOD official with performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative's strategic objectives, or end state, were important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a clear definition of rebalance could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance from activities that were peripheral to that effort. Similarly, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress, and facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives. In moving forward in the Asia-Pacific region, considering the identification of strategic end states as well as other missing elements could help position DOD to achieve its objectives in the region."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3841}

In 2015, the IRS established an Identity Assurance Office (IAO) to oversee its authentication programs and initiatives. The IAO identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require authentication, categorizing them based on potential risks. In 2016, IAO released a Roadmap for developing a secure authentication environment for all taxpayers.\n\nThe report notes that the IRS is collaborating with industry members and state partners through the Security Summit to improve information sharing, fraud detection, and address common IDT challenges. The Authentication Workgroup within the Security Summit is working on initiatives to verify the authenticity of taxpayers and returns at the time of filing.\n\nThe report acknowledges that the IRS has made progress on some efforts identified in its Roadmap but has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them. One of the foundational initiatives is to send event-driven notifications to taxpayers, which could help detect fraudulent activity at the earliest stage. However, the IRS has not identified the resources required to complete this initiative, and it will take between 6 months to 3 years to complete.\n\nThe report also highlights two areas that the IRS must address to better protect taxpayers against future threats. First, the IRS is in the process of implementing the new NIST guidance for secure online authentication but has not yet established detailed plans to fully implement it. Second, the IRS lacks a comprehensive, repeatable process to identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and approaches.\n\nThe report recommends that the IRS estimate the resources required for the foundational initiatives and prioritize its initiatives, develop a plan for implementing changes consistent with the new NIST guidance, and establish a process to identify and evaluate available authentication technologies and services. The IRS agreed with these recommendations.\n\nIn conclusion, the report emphasizes the importance of strengthening the IRS's authentication environment to stay ahead of fraudsters' schemes and protect taxpayers' personally identifiable information. The IRS's efforts to address these issues will help improve authentication, reduce tax refund fraud, and better position the agency to respond to unexpected threats.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's June 2018 report, entitled Identity Theft: IRS Needs to Strengthen Taxpayer Authentication Efforts ( GAO-18-418 ).

IRS authenticates millions of taxpayers each year via telephone, online, in person, and correspondence to ensure that it is interacting with legitimate taxpayers. IRS's estimated costs to authenticate taxpayers vary by channel. IRS has made progress on monitoring and improving authentication, including developing an authentication strategy with high-level strategic efforts. However, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. Doing so would help IRS clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits. Further, while IRS regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications, it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence channels, including mechanisms to collect reliable, useful data to monitor authentication outcomes. As a result, IRS may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system. IRS can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters. While IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) new guidance for secure digital authentication, it does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement it by June 2018, as required by the Office of Management and Budget. As a result, IRS may not be positioned to address its most vulnerable authentication areas in a timely manner. Further, IRS lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies.

The report highlights several areas for improvement in data collection, accuracy, and transparency.\n\n1. Data Limitations: The report suggests that the Coast Guard's data on commercial fishing vessel safety and accidents is incomplete, making it difficult to calculate accurate statistics and trends. The Coast Guard is recommended to improve the completeness of its data and work with stakeholders to establish a reliable estimate of the active commercial fishing vessel population.\n\n2. Asset Performance Data: The report suggests that the Coast Guard's asset performance data is often unrealistic due to assumptions about asset capacity and unscheduled maintenance. The Coast Guard is recommended to incorporate field unit input on actual asset performance to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions.\n\n3. Performance Goal Data: The report raises concerns about the reliability and validity of some performance goals, such as recreational boating deaths and injuries, and incursions of foreign fishing vessels. The Coast Guard is recommended to assess and improve the reliability and validity of its performance data.\n\n4. Transparency: The report notes that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report has not been publicly released since 2011, and that some missions, such as defense readiness, have no publicly reported or shared goals. The report recommends that future Coast Guard APRs be made publicly available.\n\n5. Capital Planning Transparency: The report suggests that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made during the annual budget cycle. The report recommends that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan to address affordability challenges and make tradeoff decisions.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that without these improvements, the Coast Guard may continue to face challenges in meeting its missions, planning for future acquisitions, and ensuring transparency and accountability.", "answers": ["The Coast Guard, a component of DHS, serves as the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a leading role in securing the nation's public and private critical infrastructure, with cybersecurity professionals being essential in mitigating vulnerabilities and defending against cyber threats.\n\nThe report highlights the ongoing shortage of cybersecurity and IT talent in both the federal government and private industry, which poses a risk to the security of federal IT systems. The Office of Management and Budget has identified this issue as a high-risk area since 1997, and it has been exacerbated by challenges in identifying and closing skill gaps, recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and navigating the federal hiring process.\n\nTo address this issue, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) was established in 2010, a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector. In 2013, NICE published the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, which provides a consistent way to define and describe cybersecurity work at any organization. This framework includes 7 categories and 33 specialty areas, with roles and tasks for each work role, as well as the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities.\n\nIn 2017, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) developed a 3-digit employment code for each cybersecurity work role, with a crosswalk of the 2-digit codes used previously. However, the report finds that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not effectively implemented these codes, with delays in establishing procedures, incomplete procedures for vacant positions, and a lack of verification and review of component-developed procedures.\n\nThe report also notes that DHS has not yet identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014. The report concludes by recommending that DHS should develop procedures for identifying vacant cybersecurity positions, assign responsibility for leading and overseeing the identification and coding of cybersecurity positions, and establish a process for reviewing component procedures.

The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to all of the department's cybersecurity workforce positions. These codes define work roles and tasks for cybersecurity specialty areas such as program management and system administration. Further, the act required DHS to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce critical needs. GAO was asked to testify on the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. To do so, GAO summarized the findings discussed in its February 2018 report on DHS's cybersecurity workforce ( GAO-18-175 ). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 ; however, its actions have not been timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS did not complete efforts to identify all of the department's cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. In August 2017, DHS reported to Congress that it had coded 95 percent of the department's identified cybersecurity positions. However, the department had, at that time, coded approximately 79 percent of the positions. DHS's 95 percent estimate was overstated primarily because it excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions. In addition, although DHS has taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it has not identified or reported to Congress on its departmentwide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also has not reported annually its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required, and has not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. (See table). Without ensuring that its procedures are complete and that its progress in identifying and assigning codes to its cybersecurity positions is accurately reported, DHS will not be positioned to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning. Further, until DHS establishes plans and time frames for reporting on its critical needs, the department may not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department's and the nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The commitment of DHS's leadership to addressing these matters is essential to helping the department fulfill the act's requirements. In its February 2018 report, GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed.

The FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations acts funded the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. The FY2018 appropriations act included a slight increase for discretionary conservation programs compared to FY2017 levels, while the FY2019 appropriations act decreased funding for discretionary conservation programs below FY2018 levels and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers all discretionary conservation programs, with the largest program being Conservation Operations (CO), which funds Conservation Technical Assistance, Soil Surveys, Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting, and Plant Materials Centers. The FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations also included funding for Watershed activities, including $150 million annually for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) and $10 million annually for Watershed Rehabilitation.

Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018. FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including USDA, unfinished. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2019 (H.R. 5961, S. 2976), with the Senate having amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus (H.R. 6147). Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018, at the FY2018 level (P.L. 115-245). After December 21, 2018, a partial shutdown of the government, including many agencies within USDA, occurred. One of the few exceptions was the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown. On January 25, 2019, an agreement was reached to continue funding for USDA and other appropriations that had lapsed through February 15, at the FY2018 level (P.L. 116-5). The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on February 15, 2019, funding USDA through the end of the fiscal year (Division B, P.L. 116-6). Agricultural conservation programs include both mandatory and discretionary spending. Most conservation program funding is mandatory and is authorized in omnibus farm bills. Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary and are funded through annual appropriations. The largest discretionary program is the Conservation Operations (CO) account, which funds conservation planning and implementation assistance on private agricultural lands across the country. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million for CO, an increase from the FY2017 enacted amount ($864 million). The enacted FY2019 appropriation decreases funding for CO below FY2018 levels to $819 million and redirects funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. Other discretionary spending is primarily for watershed programs. The largest—Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO)—was funded at $150 million annually in FY2018 and FY2019. Most mandatory conservation programs are authorized in omnibus farm bills and do not require an annual appropriation. However, Congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) in the annual agricultural appropriations law every year since FY2003. The enacted FY2018 omnibus marks the first appropriation since FY2002 that did not include CHIMPS to mandatory conservation programs. The enacted FY2019 appropriation also does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs, as most programs' authorizations expired on September 30, 2018, making these programs ineligible for reduction. The 2018 farm bill (Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs. While this is infrequent, the Agriculture appropriations bill may also serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act included two such amendments—one to WFPO and one to farm bill conservation program reporting requirements. The WFPO amendment increased the size threshold required for congressional approval. Under the amended language, the Senate and House Agriculture Committees must approve WFPO projects that include an estimated federal contribution of more than $25 million for construction, an increase from the previous $5 million threshold. Additionally, the FY2018 appropriations act exempted farm bill conservation programs from select federal reporting requirements, including obtaining a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and System for Award Management (SAM) registration. Agriculture appropriations bills may also include policy-related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out the appropriation. The FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations acts both include policy provisions for conservation programs that range from reports to Congress to suggested natural resource priorities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3481}

The program is administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) at the Department of Labor (DOL), with grants distributed to both national grantee organizations and state agencies. In PY2018, about 78% of formula grant funds were distributed to national grantees, while 22% were allocated to state agencies.\n\nTo be eligible for the program, participants must be unemployed, with a family income of not more than 125% of the poverty level. Priority is given to individuals with additional barriers to employment, such as being 65 or older, having a disability, limited English proficiency, low literacy skills, residing in a rural area, being a veteran, or being homeless or at risk of homelessness. Participants are paid by host agencies, earning at least the federal minimum wage or the prevailing minimum wage in their locality.\n\nGrantees are required to manage programs such that the average duration of participation for all participants does not exceed 27 months, with a cap of 36 months in certain circumstances. Participants are not federal employees, and grantees must ensure that they are not considered employees of the grantee, subgrantee, or host agency under applicable laws. Grantees must also match SCSEP grants, with DOL able to waive match requirements in cases of emergency or disaster projects or projects in economically depressed areas.\n\nTitle V of the OAA does not establish a definition for \"part-time\" and does not limit the number of hours participants can work.

The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019. In FY2019, SCSEP appropriations accounted for about 20% of the funding under the OAA. The bulk of SCSEP appropriations support two primary grant streams: one to national nonprofit organizations and one to state agencies. In the most recent program year, approximately 78% of formula grant funds were allocated to national grantees and about 22% were allocated to state grantees. Both the national organizations and state grantees subgrant funds to host agencies that provide the actual community service employment opportunities to participants. Host agencies are responsible for recruiting eligible participants. To be eligible for the program, prospective participants must be at least age 55, low-income, and unemployed. Federal law requires host agencies to give preference to prospective participants who demonstrate additional barriers to employment such as having a disability or being at risk of homelessness.

{"pred": "The report, published by a government agency in March 2018, provides an analysis of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (PTAB) CBM (Covered Business Method) program, which allows parties to challenge the validity of patents accused of infringement. From September 2012 to September 2017, 524 petitions were filed under the CBM program, targeting 359 distinct patents. The average number of monthly CBM petitions fluctuated during this period, with an average of 9 petitions per month in the early years, declining to fewer than 5 per month in the last fiscal year.\n\nThe decline in CBM petitions is attributed to several factors, including clarification of patent eligibility by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, the targeting of low-quality business method patents in the early years of the program, and patent owners becoming more cautious about asserting their intellectual property. Some stakeholders expressed concern about multiple petitions being filed against the same patent, with concerns that this could be used as a tool to increase costs and delay district court proceedings.\n\nThe report found that the PTAB had completed reviews of 329 of the 359 patents challenged under the program, with about one-third of these patents having at least some claims ruled unpatentable. The PTAB's high rate of invalidating patent claims (96.7%) may seem high, but is largely due to the criteria for accepting CBM trials, which require a high likelihood that at least one claim is unpatentable. The actual rate of unpatentability is 35.6% when considering all CBM petitions with an outcome.\n\nThe report also addresses concerns about the consistency of PTAB's trial decisions, noting that while the board has review processes in place, it lacks documented procedures for ensuring consistency. The report recommends that the Director of the USPTO develop guidance for judges reviewing decisions and processes leading to decisions. The USPTO has agreed with this recommendation and is taking steps to address it.\n\nThe report concludes that the CBM program has reduced litigation involving business method patents, with fewer lawsuits being filed and existing ones often dropped after patents have been through the CBM program.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's March 2018 report, entitled U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: Assessment of the Covered Business Method Patent Review Program ( GAO-18-320 ). From September 2012 through September 2017, entities facing patent infringement lawsuits filed 524 petitions challenging the validity of 359 patents under the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO) covered business method (CBM) program, resulting in decisions against about one-third of these patents. The CBM program provides entities facing infringement lawsuits an opportunity to challenge the validity of a business method patent by demonstrating that it did not meet requirements for patentability. Business method patents focus on ways of doing business in areas such as banking or e-commerce. The rate of filing petitions over this period has fluctuated but has generally declined since 2015, and none were filed in August or September 2017. USPTO has taken several steps to ensure the timeliness of trial decisions, review past decisions, and engage with stakeholders to improve proceedings under the program: Timeliness: USPTO regularly informs relevant parties about paperwork requirements and due dates throughout trials. According to program data, as of September 2017, all 181 completed trials were completed within statutorily required time frames. Decision review: USPTO has taken several steps to review its decisions and has monitored the rate at which the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms or reverses them. However, USPTO does not have guidance, such as documented procedures, for reviewing trial decisions, or the processes leading to decisions, for consistency. Without guidance, such as documented procedures, USPTO cannot fully ensure that it is meeting its objective of ensuring consistency of decisions. Stakeholder engagement: USPTO judges have engaged with stakeholders by participating in public roundtables and webinars, and attending judicial conferences, among other things. Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally agreed that the CBM program has reduced lawsuits involving business method patents in the federal courts.

The report outlines U.S. nonproliferation activities, which are coordinated across multiple government agencies, international entities, national laboratories, industry, and academia. The report emphasizes the importance of U.S. obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays a crucial role in verifying that nuclear material is not diverted for weapons use.\n\nThe report also discusses the Administration's fiscal year 2018 plan for verification and monitoring, which is more detailed than previous plans. The plan provides details on verification, detection, and monitoring requirements, roles and responsibilities, and ongoing R&D efforts. However, it does not include estimates of future costs and funding needs, which the report suggests could help Congress prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs.\n\nThe report makes a recommendation for the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to include estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. The NNSA did not agree or disagree with this recommendation, stating that it had briefed the appropriate congressional committees about the challenges of providing cost and funding data. The report suggests that the absence of cost and funding estimates raises questions about the effectiveness of interagency coordination and strategic planning for nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring efforts.", "answers": ["Countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a national security priority that is challenged by weapons advances from existing nuclear states and other actors possessing or attempting to possess nuclear weapons. To help address these issues, Congress directed the Administration in 2015 and 2017 to develop a plan for verification and monitoring relating to the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons, components of such weapons, and fissile material. GAO reviewed the first plan submitted to Congress in 2015, and an update submitted in 2017. GAO reported in March 2018 that this plan and update generally did not address the congressionally mandated reporting requirements. In the fiscal year 2018 NDAA, Congress directed the Administration to develop another plan and included a provision for GAO to review the plan. This report assesses whether the Administration's new plan provided details on the reporting requirements included in the NDAA. To determine whether the plan provided details on the reporting requirements, GAO reviewed the fiscal year 2018 plan and assessed whether the plan included details for each of the elements as required by the NDAA. GAO found that the 2018 plan provided details on most of the reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018, but did not include information on future costs and funding needs (see table below). In the NDAA, Congress directed the President to produce a plan that would address four reporting requirements: (1) a plan and roadmap on verification, detection and monitoring efforts, including details on costs and funding needs over 10 years, (2) an international engagement plan, (3) a research and development plan, and (4) a description of interagency engagement. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy, developed the plan and submitted it to Congress in April 2018. According to NNSA officials, NNSA did not include long-term costs and funding needs in the plan because identifying these needs is unrealistic for several reasons, including because agencies have little influence over the spending priorities of other departments outside of the President's budget process. However, NNSA and other agencies already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates for other programs. Because the plan does not include any estimates on future costs and funding needs, it limits congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation's verification and monitoring efforts and its ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. GAO has previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. GAO recommends that the Administrator of NNSA should include in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan.
