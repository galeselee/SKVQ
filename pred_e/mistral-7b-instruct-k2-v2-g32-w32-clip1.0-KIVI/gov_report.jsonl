{"pred": "The report, titled \"Understanding and Managing Information Technology Supply Chain Risks in Federal Agencies,\" highlights the complexity of information system design and development, particularly the intricate global supply chains involved. These supply chains can be long, complex, and distributed across multiple countries, making it challenging for federal agencies to have visibility, understanding, or control over the technology they acquire. The report emphasizes that federal agencies rely heavily on IT equipment manufactured in foreign nations, with many components having potential origins in various countries.\n\nThe report discusses the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, which requires federal agencies to develop and implement an agency-wide information security program. It also mentions several guidelines and requirements issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to help federal agencies manage information and communications technology supply chain risks.\n\nThe report identifies several potential threats to federal agencies' information systems, including the installation of hardware or software containing malicious logic, counterfeit hardware or software, failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products, reliance on a malicious or unqualified service provider, and installation of hardware or software with unintentional vulnerabilities.\n\nThe report notes that while some national security-related agencies have made progress in addressing supply chain risks, others have made limited progress. It makes several recommendations to improve the management of IT supply chain risks, including developing and documenting departmental policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities. The agencies generally agreed with these recommendations, and most have implemented them to some extent.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the importance of federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring IT supply chain risks as part of their information security programs, as the global IT supply chain introduces numerous security risks that could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems.", "answers": ["IT systems are essential to the operations of the federal government. The supply chain—the set of organizations, people, activities, and resources that create and move a product from suppliers to end users—for IT systems is complex and global in scope. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IT supply chain is a continuing threat. Federal security guidelines provide for managing the risks to the supply chain. This testimony statement highlights information security risks associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT systems. The statement also summarizes GAO's 2012 report that assessed the extent to which four national security-related agencies had addressed such risks. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previous reports, as well as information provided by the national security-related agencies on their actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations. GAO also reviewed federal information security guidelines and directives. Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal information systems. Supply chain threats are present during the various phases of an information system's development life cycle and could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies. Information technology (IT) supply chain-related threats are varied and can include: installation of intentionally harmful hardware or software (i.e., containing “malicious logic”); installation of counterfeit hardware or software; failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products; reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers for the performance of technical services; and installation of hardware or software containing unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defective code. These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of materials needed to develop systems. These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include the acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; inadequate testing of software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain. GAO reported in 2012 that the four national security-related agencies in its review—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. Of the four agencies, Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. It had defined and implemented supply chain protection controls, and initiated efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Conversely, Energy and DHS had not developed or documented policies and procedures that defined security measures for protecting against IT supply chain threats and had not developed capabilities for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. Although Justice had defined supply chain protection measures, it also had not developed or documented procedures for implementing or monitoring the measures. Energy and Justice fully implemented the recommendations that GAO made in its 2012 report and resolved the deficiencies that GAO had identified with their supply chain risk management efforts by 2016. DHS also fully implemented two recommendations to document policies and procedures for defining and implementing security measures to protect against supply chain threats by 2015, but could not demonstrate that it had fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to assess the effectiveness of the security measures. In its 2012 report, GAO recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The departments generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3092}
{"pred": "The report, issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), examines the funding awarded by the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor (DOL), and Justice (DOJ) to faith-based organizations (FBOs) between 2007 and 2015, focusing on grants subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring.\n\nThe report found that from 2007 to 2015, at least 2,586 grantees received funding through at least 53 grant programs across the three departments, with 931 of these grantees being potential FBOs. However, only 117 of these potential FBOs self-certified as exempt from religious-based hiring restrictions, with 9 of them being awarded DOJ grants.\n\nThe Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within HHS, was the only grant program where nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients and no grants were awarded to FBOs.\n\nThe report also highlights that the Departments varied in their methods for providing information about religious-based hiring restrictions and exemption options to grantees. For example, DOJ made this information available on agency web pages and through grant announcements, while DOL and HHS provided it through web pages and grant application forms.\n\nThe report also interviewed several FBOs that received funding but did not self-certify as exempt, finding that some were unaware of the exemption option or did not consider religion in their hiring decisions.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that the Departments require grantees seeking exemptions from religious-based hiring restrictions to self-certify, but the review and approval processes for these requests vary across the departments. The report recommends that the Departments improve their communication of exemption options to grantees and consider implementing a standardized process for reviewing and approving exemption requests.", "answers": ["The federal government provides billions of dollars in grant funding to organizations offering social services, including FBOs. In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring. GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption. GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites. All three agencies require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions. For example, DOJ, DOL, and HHS have policies requiring grantees to submit their exemption self-certification, but only DOL reviews exemption requests and either approves them or provides a reason for denial."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2968}
