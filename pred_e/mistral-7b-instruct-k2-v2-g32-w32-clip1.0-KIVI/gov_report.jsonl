{"pred": "The report, titled \"Understanding and Managing Information Technology Supply Chain Risks in Federal Agencies,\" highlights the complexity of information system design and development, particularly the intricate global supply chains involved. These supply chains can be long, complex, and distributed across multiple countries, making it challenging for federal agencies to have visibility, understanding, or control over the technology they acquire. The report emphasizes that federal agencies rely heavily on IT equipment manufactured in foreign nations, with many components having potential origins in various countries.\n\nThe report discusses the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, which requires federal agencies to develop and implement an agency-wide information security program. It also mentions several guidelines and requirements issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to help federal agencies manage information and communications technology supply chain risks.\n\nThe report identifies several potential threats to federal agencies' information systems, including the installation of hardware or software containing malicious logic, counterfeit hardware or software, failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products, reliance on a malicious or unqualified service provider, and installation of hardware or software with unintentional vulnerabilities.\n\nThe report notes that while some national security-related agencies have made progress in addressing supply chain risks, others have made limited progress. It makes several recommendations to improve the management of IT supply chain risks, including developing and documenting departmental policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities. The agencies generally agreed with these recommendations, and most have implemented them to some extent.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the importance of federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring IT supply chain risks as part of their information security programs, as the global IT supply chain introduces numerous security risks that could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems.", "answers": ["IT systems are essential to the operations of the federal government. The supply chain—the set of organizations, people, activities, and resources that create and move a product from suppliers to end users—for IT systems is complex and global in scope. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IT supply chain is a continuing threat. Federal security guidelines provide for managing the risks to the supply chain. This testimony statement highlights information security risks associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT systems. The statement also summarizes GAO's 2012 report that assessed the extent to which four national security-related agencies had addressed such risks. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previous reports, as well as information provided by the national security-related agencies on their actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations. GAO also reviewed federal information security guidelines and directives. Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal information systems. Supply chain threats are present during the various phases of an information system's development life cycle and could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies. Information technology (IT) supply chain-related threats are varied and can include: installation of intentionally harmful hardware or software (i.e., containing “malicious logic”); installation of counterfeit hardware or software; failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products; reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers for the performance of technical services; and installation of hardware or software containing unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defective code. These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of materials needed to develop systems. These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include the acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; inadequate testing of software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain. GAO reported in 2012 that the four national security-related agencies in its review—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. Of the four agencies, Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. It had defined and implemented supply chain protection controls, and initiated efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Conversely, Energy and DHS had not developed or documented policies and procedures that defined security measures for protecting against IT supply chain threats and had not developed capabilities for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. Although Justice had defined supply chain protection measures, it also had not developed or documented procedures for implementing or monitoring the measures. Energy and Justice fully implemented the recommendations that GAO made in its 2012 report and resolved the deficiencies that GAO had identified with their supply chain risk management efforts by 2016. DHS also fully implemented two recommendations to document policies and procedures for defining and implementing security measures to protect against supply chain threats by 2015, but could not demonstrate that it had fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to assess the effectiveness of the security measures. In its 2012 report, GAO recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The departments generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3092}

However, only 117 of these potential FBOs self-certified as exempt from religious-based hiring restrictions, with 9 of them being awarded DOJ grants.\n\nThe Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within HHS, was the only grant program where nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients and no grants were awarded to FBOs.\n\nThe report also highlights that the Departments varied in their methods for providing information about religious-based hiring restrictions and exemption options to grantees. For example, DOJ made this information available on agency web pages and through grant announcements, while DOL and HHS provided it through web pages and grant application forms.\n\nThe report also interviewed several FBOs that received funding but did not self-certify as exempt, finding that some were unaware of the exemption option or did not consider religion in their hiring decisions.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that the Departments require grantees seeking exemptions from religious-based hiring restrictions to self-certify, but the review and approval processes for these requests vary across the departments. The report recommends that the Departments improve their communication of exemption options to grantees and consider implementing a standardized process for reviewing and approving exemption requests.", "answers": ["The federal government provides billions of dollars in grant funding to organizations offering social services, including FBOs. In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring. GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption. GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites. All three agencies require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions. For example, DOJ, DOL, and HHS have policies requiring grantees to submit their exemption self-certification, but only DOL reviews exemption requests and either approves them or provides a reason for denial."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2968}

{"pred": "The report, compiled by a government agency, focuses on the seizures of potentially harmful items by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) between 2012 and 2016. The report reveals that CBP conducted approximately 308,000 seizures of items that could pose threats to U.S. security, health, safety, business, and ecology. The majority of these seizures, about 70 percent, were made from international mail, while the remaining 30 percent were from express cargo. The seized items are categorized as either drugs or merchandise, with illegal or inadmissible drugs accounting for about 47 percent of total seizures and merchandise accounting for about 53 percent.\n\nThe report also highlights an increase in fentanyl-related deaths, leading to a heightened focus on fentanyl trafficking. While CBP's seizure data shows no fentanyl seizures between 2012 and 2015, a specific category for fentanyl was added to the Seized Asset and Case Tracking System (SEACATS) in 2016, reflecting 53 seizures of fentanyl in that year.\n\nThe report discusses the challenges faced by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in providing EAD (Electronic Advance Data) for inbound international mail, which is crucial for CBP to inspect and analyze. USPS received EAD for about half of all inbound international mail in March 2017, up from about a third for the period from April 2016 to March 2017.\n\nTwo pilot programs were initiated in 2014 and 2015 at the New York International Service Center to target certain mail for inspection using EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. However, the report notes that USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection due to challenges in locating the items within large sacks of mail.\n\nThe report recommends that CBP, in conjunction with USPS, establish measurable performance goals for these pilots, assess the performance of the pilots in achieving these goals, and evaluate the costs and benefits of using EAD for targeting mail for inspection compared to other methods. The Department of Homeland Security", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes information contained in GAO's August 2017 report, entitled International Mail Security: Costs and Benefits of Using Electronic Data to Screen Mail Need to Be Assessed ( GAO-17-606 ). U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary federal agency tasked with targeting and inspecting inbound international items and seizing illegal goods, including illegal or inadmissible drugs and merchandise. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and express consignment operators (such as FedEx and DHL) provide items to CBP for inspection. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with electronic advance data (EAD), such as the shipper's and recipient's name and address, for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement. In 2014 and 2015, USPS and CBP initiated two pilot programs at the New York International Service Center (ISC) to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. Under the pilots, CBP uses EAD to target a small number of pieces of mail each day. According to USPS officials, when USPS employees scan either individual targeted pieces or larger sacks containing this targeted mail, they are alerted that CBP has targeted the item and set the item or sack aside for inspection. According to USPS and CBP, USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection because locating targeted mail once it arrives at an ISC has been a challenge. Since the pilots began, USPS has provided CBP with about 82 percent of targeted mail for one pilot, and about 58 percent of targeted mail for the other. However, while USPS and CBP have collected some performance information for these pilots (including the percentage of targeted mail provided for inspection), this information is not linked to a specific performance target agreed upon by USPS and CBP--such as a specific percentage of targeted mail provided to CBP for inspection. Further, the agencies have not conducted an analysis to determine if the pilot programs are achieving desired outcomes. Because CBP and USPS lack clear performance goals for these pilots, they risk spending additional time and resources expanding them prior to fully assessing the pilots' success or failure. In our report we found that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing time and resources needed for the screening process--potentially decreasing costs--and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. For example, CBP has collected data on the percentage of inspections resulting in a seizure for mail inspected as a result of targeting in the pilot programs at the New York ISC. However, CBP does not collect comparable data for seizures resulting from inspections conducted based on current methods of choosing mail for inspection. In light of the challenges that collecting and using these data present, it is important that CBP and USPS carefully consider actions to enhance inbound international mail security to avoid wasting time and money on potentially ineffective and costly endeavors. In our report, we recommended that CBP, in coordination with USPS: (1) establish measureable performance goals to assess pilot programs and (2) evaluate the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection compared with other targeting methods. CBP and USPS agreed with these recommendations and CBP plans to implement them by February 28, 2018."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2565}

The program's funding and benefit structure are designed to counteract economic fluctuations, with increased tax revenues during economic growth and decreased spending on benefits, creating a surplus or reserve fund. During recessions, UC tax revenue falls, and spending rises, leading to potential insufficient funds for benefit payments. In such cases, states may opt for federal loans to meet their UC obligations, which they are required to repay with interest.\n\nThe report highlights that states have significant autonomy in managing their UC programs but must adhere to federal guidelines for prompt payment of benefits. If a state's trust fund account is depleted, it may borrow funds from the federal Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) or outside sources. If borrowing from the UTF, the state must repay the loan, plus interest, within a few years, or face increased federal taxes for employers.\n\nThe report also explains the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) within the UTF, primarily funded by excess revenue from the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA) and loans from the U.S. Treasury.

In March 2015, the GAO recommended that the FCC conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals.\n\nThe report raises concerns about the accuracy of Lifeline enrollment data, as the FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline benefits also have non-Lifeline phone service.

This testimony is based on GAO's May 2017 report and discusses steps FCC has taken to measure Lifeline's performance in meeting goals; steps FCC and USAC have taken to enhance controls over finances, subscribers, and providers; and any weaknesses that might remain. For the May 2017 report, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from FCC and USAC. GAO also analyzed subscriber data from 2014 and performed undercover tests to identify potential improper payment vulnerabilities. The results of this analysis and testing are illustrative, not generalizable. In its May 2017 report, GAO found the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated the Lifeline program's (Lifeline) performance in meeting its goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income households by providing financial support, but it has recently taken steps to begin to do so. FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized.

Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. In its May 2017 report, GAO made seven recommendations, including that FCC ensure plans to transfer the USF from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented expeditiously. FCC generally agreed with all the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3955}
{"pred": "This report, compiled by an unspecified government agency, examines the use of tax incentives to promote energy production and investment in various resources. Since the 1970s, policymakers have employed tax codes to advance energy policy objectives such as securing energy supply, reducing costs, and aligning energy production with environmental goals. The report focuses on tax incentives that support energy production and investment, revealing that until the mid-2000s, the majority of revenue losses associated with these incentives were from provisions benefiting fossil fuels. However, the balance has since shifted, with the bulk of current federal revenue losses stemming from incentives for renewable energy production and investment. Despite the growth in renewable energy production, fossil fuels continue to account for the majority of domestic energy production.\n\nThe report acknowledges several limitations, including the fact that current-year tax incentives may not directly support current-year energy production, and that varying levels of federal financial support may not necessarily reflect underlying policy rationales. Additionally, the analysis does not account for federal spending on energy that is not linked to the tax code.\n\nThe report presents data on U.S. primary energy production in 2017, revealing that fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of production, with natural gas being the largest source at 32.0%, followed by crude oil at 22.1% and coal at 17.7%. Renewable energy sources accounted for 12.8% of production, with biomass being the largest renewable contributor at 5.9%.\n\nIn 2017, the tax code provided an estimated $17.8 billion in support for the energy sector, with more than one-third of this support, $6.4 billion, coming from the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC). Fossil fuels received an estimated $4.6 billion in support, a figure that declined to $3.2 billion in 2018 due to changes in the tax legislation enacted in 2017.\n\nThe report concludes that the distribution of tax-related federal financial support for energy differs across sectors and is not necessarily proportional to the amount of energy production from various sectors. The total amount of energy-related tax incentives is projected to decline under current law", "answers": ["The U.S. tax code supports the energy sector by providing a number of targeted tax incentives, or tax incentives available only for the energy industry. Some policymakers have expressed interest in understanding how energy tax benefits are distributed across different domestic energy resources. For example, what percentage of energy-related tax benefits support fossil fuels (or support renewables)? How much domestic energy is produced using fossil fuels (or produced using renewables)? And how do these figures compare? In 2017, the value of federal tax-related support for the energy sector was estimated to be $17.8 billion. Of this, $4.6 billion (25.8%) can be attributed to tax incentives supporting fossil fuels. Tax-related support for renewables was an estimated $11.6 billion in 2017 (or 65.2% of total tax-related support for energy). The remaining tax-related support went toward nuclear energy, efficiency measures, and alternative technology vehicles. While the cost of tax incentives for renewables has exceeded the cost of incentives for fossil fuels in recent years, the majority of energy produced in the United States continues to be derived from fossil fuels. In 2017, fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production. The remaining primary energy production is attributable to renewable energy and nuclear electric resources, with shares of 12.8% and 9.5%, respectively. The balance of energy-related tax incentives has changed over time, and it is projected to continue to change, under current law, in coming years. Factors that have contributed to recent changes in the balance of energy-related tax incentives include the following: Increased tax expenditures for solar and wind. Tax expenditures associated with the energy credit for solar and the production tax credit for wind have increased substantially in recent years. Following the long-term extensions of these temporary tax benefits provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), tax expenditures for the solar energy credit are projected to remain stable for several years, before decreasing in the longer term. The expiration of tax-related support for renewable fuels. Tax-related support for renewable fuels declined substantially after the tax credits for alcohol fuels were allowed to expire at the end of 2011. Other fuels-related incentives also expired at the end of 2017 (although these may be extended as part of the \"tax extenders\"). Decline then increase in tax expenditures for fossil fuels. Tax expenditures for fossil fuels declined between 2017 and 2018, an indirect effect of the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97). Over time, however, the tax expenditures associated with permanent fossil fuels tax incentives are estimated to increase. One starting point for evaluating energy tax policy may be a calculation of subsidy relative to production level. However, a complete policy analysis might consider why the level of federal financial support differs across various energy technologies. Tax incentives for energy may support various environmental or economic objectives. For example, tax incentives designed to reduce reliance on imported petroleum may be consistent with energy security goals. Tax incentives that promote renewable energy resources may be consistent with certain environmental objectives."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3582}

The Controlled Substances Act requires entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances to register with the DEA. The Disposal Act of 2010 allows the public to dispose of unused controlled substances at authorized entities, with DEA regulations outlining three methods: disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Eligible entities, such as pharmacies and hospitals, can become authorized collectors by modifying their DEA registration, with costs and training involved. DEA regulations detail requirements for disposal bin management, such as secure installation, proper signage, and regular destruction of inner liners. As of April 2017, 2.49% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins, with most being pharmacies and hospitals. However, participation rates varied significantly by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate and many states having less than 5% participation. Factors affecting participation include costs, uncertainty over regulations, and participation in other disposal programs. The report suggests that improving communication and addressing regulatory conflicts could increase participation. The report recommends that DEA identify cost-effective methods for communicating with stakeholders and resolve conflicts with other federal regulations to encourage more entities to become authorized collectors. The report also notes that about half of the U.S. population lives within 5 miles of a disposal bin, but availability varies significantly between urban and rural areas.", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3373}

The CNMI has a population of 53,890, with the majority residing on Saipan. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 established the CW program, which allows foreign workers to work in the CNMI for up to a year through their employers. The number of CW-1 permits is determined annually by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and has been capped since 2014. The proposed Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act (S. 2325) includes provisions that would affect the CW program, such as numerical caps on permits and a new CW-3 worker designation for eligible workers who were admitted as CW-1 workers before the enactment of S. 2325.\n\nThe CNMI's economy has been growing, with a significant increase in visitor spending and investment in construction, particularly the construction of a casino in Saipan. Visitor arrivals have nearly doubled since 2011, with a rise in arrivals from China and South Korea offsetting a decline in Japanese arrivals. Employment in the CNMI has also increased since 2014, with foreign workers making up the majority of the workforce. The number of CW-1 permits has been increasing, with a significant increase in petitions from 2012 to 2016.

DHS is required to decrease the number of permits issued annually, reducing them to zero by the end of the transition period, scheduled for December 31, 2019. To implement the law, DHS established a new work permit program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers can obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI. The law was amended in August 2017 to, among other things, restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations. Proposed legislation—Senate bill S. 2325—would, among other things, extend the transition period through December 31, 2029; increase the number of available permits from the 2018 level; and set required decreases in the annual numerical limit for the permits.

This testimony discusses (1) recent trends in the CNMI economy and (2) preliminary observations about the number of approved CW-1 permits and characteristics of permit holders, drawn from GAO's ongoing work. GAO updated information about the CNMI's economy that it reported in May 2017 (see GAO-17-437 ). GAO also analyzed data and documents from U.S. agencies and the CNMI government.

In 2016, the CNMI's GDP rose by 29 percent, partly as a result of construction investment. While tourism has fluctuated in recent years, visitor arrivals in the CNMI rose by nearly a third from 2016 to 2017. After nearly a decade of annual decline, the total number of workers employed in the CNMI increased from 2013 through 2016, according to the most recent available CNMI tax data. Foreign workers made up 53 percent of those employed in 2016, compared with roughly 75 percent in 2002. GAO's preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CNMI-Only Transitional Worker (CW-1) permits for foreign workers in the CNMI grew from over 7,100 for fiscal year 2012 to nearly 13,000 for fiscal year 2017. In addition, GAO identified trends in the country of birth, occupation, and employment duration of foreign workers with CW-1 permits approved for fiscal years 2012 through 2018.

{"pred": "The report discusses the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines for source selection procedures used by the Department of Defense (DOD) in procurement. The procedures range from the tradeoff procedure to Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures. DOD may use LPTA when the requirement is clearly defined, the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, and additional technical capabilities or past performance do not offer significant value. In such cases, DOD specifies minimum requirements in the solicitation, and the award is based on the lowest price.\n\nThe report highlights that DOD may use tradeoff procedures when the requirement is less definitive, more development work is required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these instances, non-cost factors can play a dominant role in the source selection process, and tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors are allowed.\n\nThe report also discusses DOD's increased use of LPTA procedures, particularly for commercial products or services, where risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, and there is no value in paying more for higher performance. However, the report notes that DOD rarely uses LPTA for IT and support services contracts, especially for complex requirements.\n\nThe report also mentions a 2017 law (Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act) that requires DOD to revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to ensure that LPTA procedures are used only when certain criteria are met. These criteria include the ability to describe minimum performance requirements objectively, the lack of value in proposals exceeding the solicitation's minimum technical requirements, the ability to evaluate proposals with little subjectivity, the certainty that a review of technical proposals would not identify factors providing additional benefits, the inclusion of a justification for using LPTA in the contract file, and the confirmation that the lowest price offered reflects full life-cycle costs.\n\nThe report concludes that while DOD officials generally assessed whether additional value would be gained from proposals exceeding the minimum technical requirements, they did not always document their justifications for choosing LPTA procedures and did not always confirm that the lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs.

When awarding a contract competitively, DOD may use the LPTA source selection process to select the lowest-priced offer that is technically acceptable. In contrast, DOD may use the trade-off source selection process to award a higher-priced contract to a firm if the firm's offer provides greater benefit and it is worth paying the additional cost. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 calls on DOD to avoid using the LPTA process for information technology, cybersecurity, and other knowledge-based professional support services. The Act also included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's use of LPTA procedures for contracts valued at more than $10 million. This report assesses the (1) extent to which DOD used LPTA procedures for certain services, and (2) factors that contracting officials considered when deciding to use LPTA procedures. GAO reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation to identify 781 contracts valued at $10 million or above awarded by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the first half of fiscal year 2017, the most recent period for which data were available. GAO then selected 133 of these contracts for information technology and support services, which include services reflected in the Act. GAO identified that 9 contracts used LPTA procedures and reviewed 7 of these, including interviewing officials and reviewing contract documents. DOD had no comments on the draft report. During the first half of fiscal year 2017, the Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures when awarding contracts valued at $10 million or more for the types of services identified by the National Defense Authorization Act, such as information technology services. Department of Defense (DOD) guidance states that LPTA procedures are typically for requirements that are well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services with a minimal risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The figure shows the military departments' limited use of LPTA procedures for contracts for selected services. For the 7 contracts that GAO reviewed, contracting officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. Contracting officials also stated that LPTA was used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For example, the Navy used LPTA procedures to award a contract for commercially available monthly telephone maintenance services. In addition, the Air Force used LPTA procedures to award a contract for mail sorting and delivery. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to amend its regulations to require contracting officers to consider specific criteria when deciding to use LPTA procedures. DOD has not yet revised its regulations to implement Section 813.

The Capitol Rotunda is primarily used for commemoration ceremonies, Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies, artwork unveilings, presidential inauguration activities, honoring individuals lying in state or honor, and prayer vigils. The Capitol Grounds are used for events sponsored by non-federal government groups, memorial services, federal government events, and award and dedication ceremonies. Emancipation Hall, located in the Capitol Visitor Center, is used for similar purposes as the Rotunda, including commemoration ceremonies, Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies, artwork unveilings, and presidential inauguration activities.\n\nThe report highlights that the use of these spaces requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate, except for events that can be issued permits by the U.S. Capitol Police. The search for concurrent resolutions was conducted using Congress.gov, and the results were categorized based on the type of event. The report includes tables and appendices that list the concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress for the use of the Capitol Rotunda, Capitol Grounds, and Emancipation Hall, along with the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution.\n\nThe report also mentions that the largest percentage of concurrent resolutions (34.3%) authorized the use of the Rotunda for commemoration ceremonies, often of historical events. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions for the Capitol Grounds (65.5%) authorized events sponsored by non-federal government groups. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions for Emancipation Hall (46.5%) authorized the use of the space for commemoration ceremonies.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that the use of these spaces is an important part of the legislative process and serves to honor various individuals, events, and achievements. The report also notes that the use of Emancipation Hall has increased since its opening in 2007.", "answers": ["The Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out under the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol. Ninety-nine concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Rotunda between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. Use of the Capitol Grounds can be authorized either by the passage of a concurrent resolution or through an application process with the Capitol Police. A concurrent resolution is typically needed for events longer than 24 hours in duration, for events that require vehicles on the Capitol Grounds for setup, for events requiring electronics on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, and for events where a large number of Members will be in attendance. The Capitol Police's special events office handles permits and approval for all other events. One hundred twelve concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into four categories: (1) events sponsored by nonfederal-government groups; (2) memorial services; (3) events sponsored by the federal government; and (4) award and dedication ceremonies. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. These resolutions can be divided into four categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies, (2) congressional gold medal ceremonies, (3) artwork unveilings, and (4) presidential inauguration activities.

{"pred": "The report provides an analysis of the Department of Defense's (DOD) strategy documents that guided the rebalancing of U.S. military efforts towards the Pacific region from 2012 to 2016. The rebalancing strategy was initiated by President Obama in 2011, with the aim of focusing more attention on the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to over half of the world's population, several large militaries, and five nations allied with the U.S. through mutual defense treaties or agreements. PACOM, one of six geographic combatant commands, is responsible for the Pacific region and is supported by four service component commands.\n\nThe report identifies six strategy documents issued between 2012 and 2015 as relevant and representative of DOD's previous strategy to implement the rebalance to the Pacific. These documents include Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership, Quadrennial Defense Review, National Military Strategy, Guidance for the Employment of the Force, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, and PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT). These documents collectively included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective strategy for the rebalance to the Pacific, but were found to be lacking in several key areas.\n\nThe report highlights two significant gaps: the lack of a consistent definition of the rebalance to the Pacific and the absence of a documented end state for the rebalance. The absence of a consistent definition makes it difficult for policy makers to assess the strategy's effectiveness and accountability, while the lack of a documented end state makes it unclear what the ultimate goal of the rebalance effort is. The report suggests that identifying a command-wide end state and a clear and consistent definition for the rebalance could help DOD better position itself to achieve its objectives in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that, in moving forward, considering the identification of strategic end states and the inclusion of the other missing elements could help DOD achieve its objectives in the Asia-Pacific region. The report provides a draft of the report to DOD for review, and copies are being sent to relevant congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, and other relevant officials", "answers": ["In 2011, President Obama announced that the United States would turn its attention to the Asia-Pacific region and make the U.S. presence there a top priority. Rebalancing to the Pacific became strategic guidance that informed military planning. By the end of 2015, DOD published strategy documents that included references to the rebalance to the Pacific or related concepts. In February 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs stated that while DOD continues to prioritize the Asia-Pacific region, the rebalance to the Pacific is no longer U.S. policy. DOD has published the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which establishes an objective of maintaining a favorable regional balance in the Pacific region, among other regions. Prior to the change in policy, House Report 114-102 included a provision for GAO to review matters related to the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that included desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO analyzed six DOD strategy documents that officials identified as providing guidance for the rebalance to the Pacific to determine whether, as a set, they included desired elements associated with an effective national strategy. DOD had no comments on this report. Department of Defense (DOD) strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. The U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), which is responsible for the Asia-Pacific region, used DOD strategy documents to implement the President's direction to rebalance to the Pacific, which generally refocused U.S. efforts to that region. PACOM officials told GAO that there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense ; Quadrennial Defense Review ; National Military Strategy ; Guidance for the Employment of the Force ; Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan ; and the PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) . Based on GAO's analysis, DOD's six strategy documents that guided the rebalance to the Pacific included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective national strategy. However, two key elements were missing from the group of strategy documents: (1) a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific, and (2) the identification of the overall results desired, or end state, for the rebalance. DOD officials also could not identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents or provide a definition that was used consistently across the department. According to a DOD official with performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative's strategic objectives, or end state, were important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a clear definition of rebalance could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance from activities that were peripheral to that effort. Similarly, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress, and facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives. In moving forward in the Asia-Pacific region, considering the identification of strategic end states as well as other missing elements could help position DOD to achieve its objectives in the region."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3841}

In 2015, the IRS established an Identity Assurance Office (IAO) to oversee its authentication programs and initiatives. The IAO identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require authentication, categorizing them based on potential risks. In 2016, IAO released a Roadmap for developing a secure authentication environment for all taxpayers.\n\nThe report notes that the IRS is collaborating with industry members and state partners through the Security Summit to improve information sharing, fraud detection, and address common IDT challenges. The Authentication Workgroup within the Security Summit is working on initiatives to verify the authenticity of taxpayers and returns at the time of filing.\n\nThe report acknowledges that the IRS has made progress on some efforts identified in its Roadmap but has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them. One of the foundational initiatives is to send event-driven notifications to taxpayers, which could help detect fraudulent activity at the earliest stage. However, the IRS has not identified the resources required to complete this initiative, and it will take between 6 months to 3 years to complete.\n\nThe report also highlights two areas that the IRS must address to better protect taxpayers against future threats. First, the IRS is in the process of implementing the new NIST guidance for secure online authentication but has not yet established detailed plans to fully implement it. Second, the IRS lacks a comprehensive, repeatable process to identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and approaches.\n\nThe report recommends that the IRS estimate the resources required for the foundational initiatives and prioritize its initiatives, develop a plan for implementing changes consistent with the new NIST guidance, and establish a process to identify and evaluate available authentication technologies and services. The IRS agreed with these recommendations.\n\nIn conclusion, the report emphasizes the importance of strengthening the IRS's authentication environment to stay ahead of fraudsters' schemes and protect taxpayers' personally identifiable information. The IRS's efforts to address these issues will help improve authentication, reduce tax refund fraud, and better position the agency to respond to unexpected threats.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's June 2018 report, entitled Identity Theft: IRS Needs to Strengthen Taxpayer Authentication Efforts ( GAO-18-418 ).

IRS authenticates millions of taxpayers each year via telephone, online, in person, and correspondence to ensure that it is interacting with legitimate taxpayers. IRS's estimated costs to authenticate taxpayers vary by channel. IRS has made progress on monitoring and improving authentication, including developing an authentication strategy with high-level strategic efforts. However, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. Doing so would help IRS clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits. Further, while IRS regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications, it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence channels, including mechanisms to collect reliable, useful data to monitor authentication outcomes. As a result, IRS may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system. IRS can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters. While IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) new guidance for secure digital authentication, it does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement it by June 2018, as required by the Office of Management and Budget. As a result, IRS may not be positioned to address its most vulnerable authentication areas in a timely manner. Further, IRS lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies.

The report highlights several areas for improvement in data collection, accuracy, and transparency.\n\n1. Data Limitations: The report suggests that the Coast Guard's data on commercial fishing vessel safety and accidents is incomplete, making it difficult to calculate accurate statistics and trends. The Coast Guard is recommended to improve the completeness of its data and work with stakeholders to establish a reliable estimate of the active commercial fishing vessel population.\n\n2. Asset Performance Data: The report suggests that the Coast Guard's asset performance data is often unrealistic due to assumptions about asset capacity and unscheduled maintenance. The Coast Guard is recommended to incorporate field unit input on actual asset performance to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions.\n\n3. Performance Goal Data: The report raises concerns about the reliability and validity of some performance goals, such as recreational boating deaths and injuries, and incursions of foreign fishing vessels. The Coast Guard is recommended to assess and improve the reliability and validity of its performance data.\n\n4. Transparency: The report notes that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report has not been publicly released since 2011, and that some missions, such as defense readiness, have no publicly reported or shared goals. The report recommends that future Coast Guard APRs be made publicly available.\n\n5. Capital Planning Transparency: The report suggests that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made during the annual budget cycle. The report recommends that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan to address affordability challenges and make tradeoff decisions.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that without these improvements, the Coast Guard may continue to face challenges in meeting its missions, planning for future acquisitions, and ensuring transparency and accountability.", "answers": ["The Coast Guard, a component of DHS, serves as the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a leading role in securing the nation's public and private critical infrastructure, with cybersecurity professionals being essential in mitigating vulnerabilities and defending against cyber threats.\n\nThe report highlights the ongoing shortage of cybersecurity and IT talent in both the federal government and private industry, which poses a risk to the security of federal IT systems. The Office of Management and Budget has identified this issue as a high-risk area since 1997, and it has been exacerbated by challenges in identifying and closing skill gaps, recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and navigating the federal hiring process.\n\nTo address this issue, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) was established in 2010, a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector. In 2013, NICE published the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, which provides a consistent way to define and describe cybersecurity work at any organization. This framework includes 7 categories and 33 specialty areas, with roles and tasks for each work role, as well as the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities.\n\nIn 2017, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) developed a 3-digit employment code for each cybersecurity work role, with a crosswalk of the 2-digit codes used previously. However, the report finds that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not effectively implemented these codes, with delays in establishing procedures, incomplete procedures for vacant positions, and a lack of verification and review of component-developed procedures.\n\nThe report also notes that DHS has not yet identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014. The report concludes by recommending that DHS should develop procedures for identifying vacant cybersecurity positions, assign responsibility for leading and overseeing the identification and coding of cybersecurity positions, and establish a process for reviewing component procedures.

The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to all of the department's cybersecurity workforce positions. These codes define work roles and tasks for cybersecurity specialty areas such as program management and system administration. Further, the act required DHS to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce critical needs. GAO was asked to testify on the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. To do so, GAO summarized the findings discussed in its February 2018 report on DHS's cybersecurity workforce ( GAO-18-175 ). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 ; however, its actions have not been timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS did not complete efforts to identify all of the department's cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. In August 2017, DHS reported to Congress that it had coded 95 percent of the department's identified cybersecurity positions. However, the department had, at that time, coded approximately 79 percent of the positions. DHS's 95 percent estimate was overstated primarily because it excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions. In addition, although DHS has taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it has not identified or reported to Congress on its departmentwide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also has not reported annually its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required, and has not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. (See table). Without ensuring that its procedures are complete and that its progress in identifying and assigning codes to its cybersecurity positions is accurately reported, DHS will not be positioned to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning. Further, until DHS establishes plans and time frames for reporting on its critical needs, the department may not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department's and the nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The commitment of DHS's leadership to addressing these matters is essential to helping the department fulfill the act's requirements. In its February 2018 report, GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed.

The FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations acts funded the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. The FY2018 appropriations act included a slight increase for discretionary conservation programs compared to FY2017 levels, while the FY2019 appropriations act decreased funding for discretionary conservation programs below FY2018 levels and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers all discretionary conservation programs, with the largest program being Conservation Operations (CO), which funds Conservation Technical Assistance, Soil Surveys, Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting, and Plant Materials Centers. The FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations also included funding for Watershed activities, including $150 million annually for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) and $10 million annually for Watershed Rehabilitation.

Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018. FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including USDA, unfinished. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2019 (H.R. 5961, S. 2976), with the Senate having amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus (H.R. 6147). Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018, at the FY2018 level (P.L. 115-245). After December 21, 2018, a partial shutdown of the government, including many agencies within USDA, occurred. One of the few exceptions was the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown. On January 25, 2019, an agreement was reached to continue funding for USDA and other appropriations that had lapsed through February 15, at the FY2018 level (P.L. 116-5). The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on February 15, 2019, funding USDA through the end of the fiscal year (Division B, P.L. 116-6). Agricultural conservation programs include both mandatory and discretionary spending. Most conservation program funding is mandatory and is authorized in omnibus farm bills. Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary and are funded through annual appropriations. The largest discretionary program is the Conservation Operations (CO) account, which funds conservation planning and implementation assistance on private agricultural lands across the country. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million for CO, an increase from the FY2017 enacted amount ($864 million). The enacted FY2019 appropriation decreases funding for CO below FY2018 levels to $819 million and redirects funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. Other discretionary spending is primarily for watershed programs. The largest—Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO)—was funded at $150 million annually in FY2018 and FY2019. Most mandatory conservation programs are authorized in omnibus farm bills and do not require an annual appropriation. However, Congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) in the annual agricultural appropriations law every year since FY2003. The enacted FY2018 omnibus marks the first appropriation since FY2002 that did not include CHIMPS to mandatory conservation programs. The enacted FY2019 appropriation also does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs, as most programs' authorizations expired on September 30, 2018, making these programs ineligible for reduction. The 2018 farm bill (Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs. While this is infrequent, the Agriculture appropriations bill may also serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act included two such amendments—one to WFPO and one to farm bill conservation program reporting requirements. The WFPO amendment increased the size threshold required for congressional approval. Under the amended language, the Senate and House Agriculture Committees must approve WFPO projects that include an estimated federal contribution of more than $25 million for construction, an increase from the previous $5 million threshold. Additionally, the FY2018 appropriations act exempted farm bill conservation programs from select federal reporting requirements, including obtaining a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and System for Award Management (SAM) registration. Agriculture appropriations bills may also include policy-related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out the appropriation.

From September 2012 to September 2017, 524 petitions were filed under the CBM program, targeting 359 distinct patents. The average number of monthly CBM petitions fluctuated during this period, with an average of 9 petitions per month in the early years, declining to fewer than 5 per month in the last fiscal year.\n\nThe decline in CBM petitions is attributed to several factors, including clarification of patent eligibility by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, the targeting of low-quality business method patents in the early years of the program, and patent owners becoming more cautious about asserting their intellectual property. Some stakeholders expressed concern about multiple petitions being filed against the same patent, with concerns that this could be used as a tool to increase costs and delay district court proceedings.\n\nThe report found that the PTAB had completed reviews of 329 of the 359 patents challenged under the program, with about one-third of these patents having at least some claims ruled unpatentable. The PTAB's high rate of invalidating patent claims (96.7%) may seem high, but is largely due to the criteria for accepting CBM trials, which require a high likelihood that at least one claim is unpatentable. The actual rate of unpatentability is 35.6% when considering all CBM petitions with an outcome.\n\nThe report also addresses concerns about the consistency of PTAB's trial decisions, noting that while the board has review processes in place, it lacks documented procedures for ensuring consistency. The report recommends that the Director of the USPTO develop guidance for judges reviewing decisions and processes leading to decisions. The USPTO has agreed with this recommendation and is taking steps to address it.\n\nThe report concludes that the CBM program has reduced litigation involving business method patents, with fewer lawsuits being filed and existing ones often dropped after patents have been through the CBM program.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's March 2018 report, entitled U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: Assessment of the Covered Business Method Patent Review Program ( GAO-18-320 ).

The CBM program provides entities facing infringement lawsuits an opportunity to challenge the validity of a business method patent by demonstrating that it did not meet requirements for patentability. Business method patents focus on ways of doing business in areas such as banking or e-commerce. The rate of filing petitions over this period has fluctuated but has generally declined since 2015, and none were filed in August or September 2017. USPTO has taken several steps to ensure the timeliness of trial decisions, review past decisions, and engage with stakeholders to improve proceedings under the program: Timeliness: USPTO regularly informs relevant parties about paperwork requirements and due dates throughout trials.

To help address these issues, Congress directed the Administration in 2015 and 2017 to develop a plan for verification and monitoring relating to the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons, components of such weapons, and fissile material. GAO reviewed the first plan submitted to Congress in 2015, and an update submitted in 2017. GAO reported in March 2018 that this plan and update generally did not address the congressionally mandated reporting requirements. In the fiscal year 2018 NDAA, Congress directed the Administration to develop another plan and included a provision for GAO to review the plan. This report assesses whether the Administration's new plan provided details on the reporting requirements included in the NDAA. To determine whether the plan provided details on the reporting requirements, GAO reviewed the fiscal year 2018 plan and assessed whether the plan included details for each of the elements as required by the NDAA. GAO found that the 2018 plan provided details on most of the reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018, but did not include information on future costs and funding needs (see table below). In the NDAA, Congress directed the President to produce a plan that would address four reporting requirements: (1) a plan and roadmap on verification, detection and monitoring efforts, including details on costs and funding needs over 10 years, (2) an international engagement plan, (3) a research and development plan, and (4) a description of interagency engagement. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy, developed the plan and submitted it to Congress in April 2018. According to NNSA officials, NNSA did not include long-term costs and funding needs in the plan because identifying these needs is unrealistic for several reasons, including because agencies have little influence over the spending priorities of other departments outside of the President's budget process. However, NNSA and other agencies already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates for other programs. Because the plan does not include any estimates on future costs and funding needs, it limits congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation's verification and monitoring efforts and its ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. GAO has previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs.

The report highlights that VHA faces a significant challenge in meeting the growing demand for physician services due to the anticipated national shortage of physicians by 2025. The report notes that VHA employs approximately 11,000 mission-critical physicians, supplements their capacity with fee-basis and contract physicians, and uses physician trainees to fill gaps. In 2016, there were 43,768 medical residents who trained at a VHA facility. VHA has been expanding its physician training program to add 953 additional positions by 2025 to improve access and hire more physicians.\n\nThe report finds that VHA lacks complete data on the number of contract physicians and physician trainees, which makes it difficult to ensure that its workforce planning processes address any gaps in staffing. The report recommends that VHA develop a systematic process to account for all physicians providing care at its VAMCs, including those not employed by VHA. The report also notes that VHA lacks sufficient guidance for its medical and surgical specialties, such as gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery, to help VAMCs determine appropriate staffing levels. The report recommends that VHA develop and issue guidance for all mission-critical physician occupations.\n\nThe report also discusses VHA's strategies for recruiting and retaining physicians, including financial incentives, a national physician training program, and a recruitment program.

The report notes that VHA is working to include information on work-without-compensation employees, such as physician trainees, in its new human resources", "answers": ["As the demand for VHA's services grows—due, in part, to increasing demand from servicemembers returning from the United States' military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and the growing needs of an aging veteran population—attracting, hiring, and retaining top talent is critical to VHA's mission to provide high quality and timely care for the nation's veterans. Physicians—who provide and supervise a broad range of care including primary and specialty care—serve an integral role in VHA's mission. Certain physician types are consistently among the most difficult to recruit and retain, and are thus considered mission-critical by VHA. Over the past two decades, GAO and others have expressed concern about VHA's ability to ensure that it has the appropriate clinical workforce, including physicians, to meet the current and future needs of veterans. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report and examines (1) VHA information on how many mission critical physicians provided care at VAMCs, (2) VHA guidance for determining its physician staffing needs, and (3) the strategies VHA used to support the recruitment and retention of physicians at VAMCs, and the extent to which it has evaluated these strategies to determine their effectiveness. For this statement, GAO updated the information from its October 2017 report and obtained information from VHA officials in June 2018 about steps they have taken to implement the 2017 recommendations. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continues to face challenges related to physician staffing, recruitment, and retention, though it has begun work to implement recommendations made in GAO's October 2017 report. Specifically, GAO's report found the following: VHA's data on the number of physicians that provided care at VA medical centers (VAMC) were incomplete. GAO found that data were incomplete because they did not include data on the number of contract physicians and contained only limited data on the number of physician trainees—two types of physicians that augment the care provided by physicians employed by VHA. Thus, VHA data underestimated the total number of physicians providing care in its medical centers leaving it unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed gaps in staffing. GAO recommended that VHA implement a process to accurately count all its physicians. VHA did not concur with this recommendation, stating that it used other tools for workforce planning. VHA has since implemented a new human resources (HR) database—HR Smart—that has the capability to track each position at its VAMCs. However, VHA officials told us they do not plan to include information on physician contractors in this database. VHA provided VAMCs with guidance on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician occupations, although it lacked sufficient guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. GAO recommended that VHA issue guidance to VAMCs on determining appropriate staffing levels for all physicians. VHA concurred and reported it would develop staffing guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. VHA officials told GAO VHA signed a specialty care workgroup charter November 27, 2017; the primary goal of the workgroup was to develop a specialty care staffing model that would include staffing information for all specialty care. VHA anticipates completing its work and issuing staffing guidance by December 2018. VHA used various strategies to recruit and retain its physician workforce, but had not comprehensively evaluated them to assess effectiveness . Without such an evaluation, VHA did not have complete information on the underlying causes of the difficulties VAMCs face, or whether its recruitment and retention strategies were meeting physician workforce needs. GAO recommended VHA (1) establish a system-wide method to share information about physician trainees to help fill vacancies across VAMCs and (2) conduct a comprehensive, system-wide evaluation of VAMCs' physician recruitment and retention efforts and establish an ongoing monitoring program. VHA concurred and reported it has since taken steps to address the recommendations. For example, VHA's Office of Workforce Management and Consulting has partnered with its Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center to evaluate and recommend a systematic approach for allocating workforce management resources.

RPS are long-lived, reliable power sources that convert heat from Pu-238 into electrical power, providing up to 120 watts at the beginning of their life. They are used in a variety of NASA missions, including the Galileo, Cassini, and Curiosity missions, with the Mars 2020 mission also planned to use RPS.\n\nThe report highlights that the Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the design, development, and delivery of RPS to meet NASA's requirements. The DOE's Supply Project aims to reach a full Pu-238 production rate of 1.5 kg per year by 2023, with an interim production rate of 300-500 grams per year by 2019. However, challenges in chemical processing and reactor availability may delay this goal.\n\nThe report also discusses the selection of missions that use RPS. NASA selects missions based on scientific objectives and destinations, with RPS being more likely for missions to distant planets where solar power is less effective. The need for RPS is usually apparent based on the mission's scientific objectives and destination.\n\nThe report concludes by highlighting the importance of the DOE addressing the challenges in its Pu-238 production goals, particularly in chemical processing and reactor availability, to ensure the production of RPS for future NASA missions. The DOE agreed with recommendations to develop a comprehensive system for tracking risks, a plan outlining interim steps and milestones, and to assess the long-term effects of known challenges on Pu-238 production quantities, time frames, and required funding, and communicate these potential effects to NASA.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Space Exploration: DOE Could Improve Planning and Communication Related to Plutonium-238 and Radioisotope Power Systems Production Challenges ( GAO-17-673 ). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selects radioisotope power systems (RPS) for missions primarily based on the agency's scientific objectives and mission destinations. Prior to the establishment of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Supply Project in fiscal year 2011 to produce new plutonium-238 (Pu-238), NASA officials said that Pu-238 supply was a limiting factor in selecting RPS-powered missions. After the initiation of the Supply Project, however, NASA officials GAO interviewed said that missions are selected independently of decisions on how to power them. Once a mission is selected, NASA considers power sources early in its mission review process. Multiple factors could affect NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238. For example, high costs associated with RPS and missions can affect the demand for RPS because, according to officials, NASA's budget can only support one RPS mission about every 4 years. Expected technological advances in RPS efficiency could reduce NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238. DOE has made progress in reestablishing Pu-238 production to meet NASA's future demand to fuel RPS and has identified challenges to meeting its production goals. Specifically, since the start of the Supply Project, DOE has produced 100 grams of Pu-238 and expects to finalize production processes and produce interim quantities by 2019. However, DOE has also identified several challenges to meeting the Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kilograms (kg) of new Pu-238 per year by 2026. DOE officials GAO interviewed said that DOE has not perfected the chemical processing required to extract new Pu-238 from irradiated targets to meet production goals. These officials also said that achieving the Pu-238 production goal is contingent on the use of two reactors, but only one reactor is currently qualified for Pu-238 production while the second reactor awaits scheduled maintenance. Moreover, while DOE has adopted a new approach for managing the Supply Project and RPS production—based on a constant production approach—the agency has not developed an implementation plan that identifies milestones and interim steps that can be used to demonstrate progress in meeting production goals and addressing previously identified challenges. GAO's prior work shows that plans that include milestones and interim steps help an agency to set priorities, use resources efficiently, and monitor progress in achieving agency goals. By developing a plan with milestones and interim steps for DOE's approach to managing Pu-238 and RPS production, DOE can show progress in implementing its approach and make adjustments when necessary. Lastly, DOE's new approach to managing the Supply Project does not improve its ability to assess the potential long-term effects of challenges DOE identified, such as chemical processing and reactor availability, or to communicate these effects to NASA. For example, DOE officials did not explain how the new approach would help assess the long-term effects of challenges, such as those related to chemical processing. Under Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , agencies should use quality information to achieve objectives and to communicate externally, so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. Without the ability to assess the long-term effects of known challenges and communicate those effects to NASA, DOE may be jeopardizing NASA's ability to use RPS as a power source for future missions."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3082}
{"pred": "The report by a government agency provides an overview of individual market plans sold through health exchanges, focusing on four key aspects: metal tiers, premium variation and plan availability, covered benefits, and premium tax credits. The report explains that plans are offered at four levels of coverage, or metal tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—with actuarial values corresponding to the percentage of medical expenses expected to be covered by the issuer for a standard population. Issuers must offer at least one plan at the silver and gold levels, but not necessarily at the bronze or platinum levels.\n\nThe report also highlights that premiums for health plans offered through exchanges can vary widely across counties and states, with the options available to consumers changing from year to year. Premium tax credits are available to eligible consumers to reduce their out-of-pocket costs for premiums, with the amount determined based on the cost of premiums for the local benchmark plan. Consumers who are eligible for premium tax credits and enrolled in the benchmark plan generally pay a percentage of their household income toward the premium, with the tax credit applied to the portion covering essential health benefits.\n\nThe report notes that in many counties, the benchmark plan changed from 2015 to 2017, with premiums generally increasing from year to year. However, the financial impact on consumers may be limited due to premium tax credits, as eligible consumers' payments are based on a percentage of their income. The report also discusses automatic re-enrollment, where eligible returning consumers are re-enrolled in the same or a similar crosswalked plan if the original plan is no longer available.\n\nThe report concludes by providing data on the percentage of consumers who were automatically re-enrolled and those who actively re-enrolled in 2016, as well as the median net monthly premium increases for these groups. The findings suggest that consumers who actively re-enrolled had a lower median increase in their net monthly premiums compared to those who were automatically re-enrolled.

Those who do not actively enroll in a plan may be automatically reenrolled into a plan. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, automatic re-enrollment is intended to help ensure consumers' continuity in coverage. However, some have questioned whether automatic reenrollment could have unintended financial consequences for consumers. GAO was asked to review automatic reenrollment and benchmark plans. GAO examined 1) the extent to which plans identified as benchmark plans remained the same plans from year to year, and how premiums for benchmark plans changed; 2) the proportion of exchange consumers who were automatically re-enrolled into the same or similar plans, and how these proportions compared to those for consumers who actively re-enrolled, and 3) the extent to which consumers' financial responsibility for premiums changed for those who were automatically re-enrolled compared to those who actively re-enrolled. GAO reviewed relevant guidance and analyzed county-based data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the 37 states that used the federal information platform, healthcare.gov, from 2015 through 2017. GAO also interviewed CMS and ASPE officials and analyzed information from ASPE on reenrollment from 2015 to 2016. Through the exchanges established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, consumers can directly compare and select among health plans based on a variety of factors, including premiums. Most consumers who purchase health plans through the exchanges receive tax credits to help them pay for their premiums. The value of a consumer's premium tax credit is based, in part, on the premium for the benchmark plan, which is the second lowest cost option available in the consumer's local area within the exchange's silver metal tier (one of four metal tiers that indicate the value of plans). Because plan premiums and plan availability can change over time, the benchmark plan in each local market can also change over time. GAO analyzed changes in benchmark plans and premiums from 2015 through 2017 and found: In most of the nearly 2,600 counties included in the analysis, the plans identified as benchmark plans, and the premiums for these plans, changed from year to year. For example, in 85 percent of counties, the 2015 benchmark plans were not benchmark plans in either 2016 or 2017. Gross benchmark premiums (exclusive of tax credits) increased from year to year, and increases were higher from 2016 to 2017 than they were from 2015 to 2016. Premium tax credits would limit the costs of increasing premiums for most consumers, though some consumers, including those not eligible for premium tax credits, would have incurred more or all of the higher premium costs. During the annual open enrollment period, consumers who do not make an active plan selection are automatically reenrolled into their existing plan or, if that plan is no longer available, they are generally re-enrolled into a similar plan if one has been identified. GAO analyzed information from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) for consumers enrolled in both 2015 and 2016 and found: About 30 percent of consumers were automatically re-enrolled in 2016, while the remaining 70 percent chose to actively re-enroll. Median net monthly premiums—what consumers paid after premium tax credits—increased less from 2015 to 2016 for those who actively enrolled ($5) than for those who were automatically reenrolled ($22), although there was variation.

The report focuses on the status of ESF assistance and projects, payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors, and compliance with antiterrorism policies and procedures.\n\nAs of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated approximately $544.1 million and expended about $350.6 million of the $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. Project assistance accounted for about 74% and 72% of obligations for these fiscal years, while payments to the PA's creditors accounted for the remaining 26% and 28%.\n\nThe report highlights three main development objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure, Investing in the Next Generation, and Governance and Civic Engagement. The largest share of project assistance supported the Economic Growth and Infrastructure objective, with about $239 million obligated and $89 million expended as of March 31, 2018. The second-largest share supported the Investing in the Next Generation objective, with about $107 million obligated and $79 million expended. The smallest share supported the Governance and Civic Engagement objective, with about $24.6 million obligated and $14.5 million expended.\n\nUSAID made direct payments to PA creditors totaling about $75 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $70 million from fiscal year 2016 funds. These payments were made to cover debts for petroleum purchases and medical referrals to hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. Before making these payments, USAID vetted each PA creditor to ensure they were not associated with terrorism, as required by Mission Order 21.\n\nThe report also discusses the external assessments of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning, which identified weaknesses in their medical referral and petroleum procurement", "answers": ["Since 1993, the U.S. government has committed more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016. The audits did not identify any ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the agreements.

The rule, first established in 1837, prohibits the inclusion of non-appropriation related provisions in general appropriations bills, except for retrenchment amendments that reduce expenditures or the number of federal officials, or the compensation of individuals paid from the Treasury.\n\nThe report traces the evolution of the Holman Rule, including its expansion in 1876 to include retrenchments that reduce expenditures, and its subsequent amendments and revisions over the years. In 1983, the rule was amended to narrow its exception to retrenchments that reduce amounts of money covered by the bill. In the 115th Congress, a separate order was adopted to further expand the scope of the exception to include reductions in the number and salary of federal officials and compensation of individuals paid out of the Treasury.\n\nThe report also discusses the limitations of the Holman Rule, such as its applicability only to funds appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill, and the requirement for germaneness of amendments. It emphasizes that the House Parliamentarian is the definitive authority on questions related to the chamber's precedents and procedures.\n\nIn summary, the Holman Rule is a long-standing Congressional rule that separates authorization from appropriation, and allows for limited exceptions for retrenchment amendments that reduce expenditures or the number of federal officials.

Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

The report commends the Department of Defense (DOD) and DLA for taking steps to address previously identified weaknesses in the LESO program, including revisions to policies, procedures, and the implementation of a new data system. However, the report identifies weaknesses in three areas: verifying and approving applications, transferring property, and assessing risk.\n\nThe report found that the LESO program's internal controls were not adequate to prevent the approval of a fraudulent application. The program's reliance on electronic communications without actual verification and lack of supervisory approval and confirmation of application with designated points of contact at headquarters were cited as concerns.

The RFS aims to diversify the energy portfolio, strengthen rural economies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The mandate includes four renewable fuel categories: conventional biofuel (e.g., corn starch ethanol), advanced biofuel (e.g., cellulosic ethanol), cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel. The RFS has faced challenges in meeting the annual volume requirements, particularly for advanced biofuels, due to infrastructure, technology, and limited federal assistance.\n\nKey challenges include a lack of cellulosic biofuel production, delays by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in approving fuel pathways, and concerns about the transparency of the market where credits are traded. The program has also been criticized for its complexity and the time it takes for EPA to approve new fuel pathways, which can stifle investment and production of new fuels.\n\nThe RFS has been subject to scrutiny in Congress and litigation over EPA's regulations. Some stakeholders have expressed concerns about the Trump Administration's issuance of multiple small refinery exemptions, which they believe could adversely affect biofuel demand. The RFS has been successful in meeting the statutory targets for conventional biofuel and biomass-based diesel, but challenges remain in meeting the advanced biofuel targets.\n\nThe RFS requires obligated parties (generally, refiners) to submit renewable identification numbers (RINs) to demonstrate compliance with the mandate. These RINs are valid for use in the year they are generated and the following year. The EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) is used to register RIN transactions. The RFS has a nested structure, with some fuels qualifying for multiple categories, and different fuels generating different numbers of RINs per volume due to differences in energy content.\n\nThe RFS has been criticized for its complexity and the time it takes for EPA to approve new fuel pathways, which can affect private investment and create uncertainty in", "answers": ["The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has statutory authority to determine the volume amounts after 2022. The total renewable fuel statutory target consists of both conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel. Since 2014, the total renewable fuel statutory target has not been met, with the advanced biofuel portion falling below the statutory target by a large margin since 2015. Going forward, it is unlikely that the United States will meet the total renewable fuel target as outlined in statute. EPA administers the RFS and is responsible for several tasks. For instance, within statutory criteria EPA evaluates which renewable fuels are eligible for the RFS program. Also, EPA establishes the amount of renewable fuel that will be required for the coming year based on fuel supply and other conditions although waiver authority in the statute allows the EPA Administrator to reduce the statutory volumes if necessary. Further, the statute requires that the EPA Administrator \"reset\" the RFS—whereby the fuel volumes required for future years are modified by the Administrator if certain conditions are met. EPA monitors compliance for the RFS using a system of tradable credits referred to as renewable identification numbers (RINs). Congress has expressed ongoing interest in the RFS, particularly as the mandate relates to other legislative efforts (e.g., Reid Vapor Pressure requirements for ethanol-gasoline fuel blends containing greater than 10% ethanol, a national octane standard) and about oversight of the RIN market, among other things. Some assert it is time to amend or repeal the RFS, while others contend the best course of action is to maintain the status quo. For instance, some Members contend the RFS hurts consumers by creating an artificial market for ethanol. Others see ethanol as a part of a competitive energy strategy. Congress may also express interest in how the EPA Administrator applies the RFS \"reset\" authority.

The report covers five key areas: identifying high-risk chemical facilities, assessing risk and prioritizing facilities, reviewing and approving facility security plans, conducting compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach.\n\nThe report highlights several issues, including:\n\n1. In 2014, more than 1,300 facilities reported having ammonium nitrate to DHS, but a review of state data revealed more facilities with ammonium nitrate holdings, indicating some noncompliance. DHS has since addressed this issue by comparing data with other federal agencies and member states, identifying approximately 1,000 additional noncompliant facilities, and contacting them to ensure compliance.\n\n2. In 2016, DHS implemented an updated Top-Screen to address errors in the Distance of Concern submitted by facilities, and identified 158 facilities with the potential to cause the greatest harm. As of May 2017, 145 of these facilities had undergone a quality assurance review process.\n\n3. The report also addresses DHS's risk assessment approach, which was found to not consider all elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence associated with a terrorist attack. DHS has since worked with Sandia National Laboratories and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop a new tiering methodology, called the Second Generation Risk Engine, to better assess regulated facilities' risks.\n\n4. The report notes that DHS has made progress in reviewing and approving facility security plans, eliminating the backlog of plans awaiting review, and implementing an Expedited Approval Program for smaller chemical facilities. However, participation in the expedited program has been low due to factors such as strict security measures, lack of an authorization inspection, and changes to the CFATS program.\n\n5. The report also mentions that DHS has taken steps to document processes and procedures for managing compliance, and has begun soliciting feedback on outreach with industry stakeholders.\n\nOverall, the report finds that DHS has made progress in addressing the open recommendations from past work, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in data sharing", "answers": ["Thousands of facilities have hazardous chemicals that could be targeted or used to inflict mass casualties or harm surrounding populations in the United States. In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2993}
{"pred": "The report by the National Research Council (NRC) discusses the effects of radiation exposure, focusing on both high and low doses. High doses, such as those experienced by survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan, can lead to immediate symptoms like nausea, fatigue, and potentially death within days or weeks. These high doses can also cause cancers such as leukemia and colon cancer. In contrast, the effects of low-dose radiation (below 100 millisieverts or 10 rem) are less clear, as data do not definitively establish a dose-response relationship for cancer and radiation exposure.\n\nFederal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have developed radiation protection requirements and guidance based on advice from scientific advisory bodies like the International Commission on Radiological Protection, National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies’ Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. These advisory bodies use the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that any increase in radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer.\n\nThe report highlights that federal agencies have set dose limits for radiation exposure, with the NRC's annual dose limit for members of the public from nuclear power plants being a hundredth of the level the National Academies considers low dose. These limits are applied differently depending on the setting, with higher limits for occupational exposure. The FDA, on the other hand, regulates the maximum radiation output of medical equipment but does not generally set limits on the total amount of radiation exposure to patients.\n\nThe report also discusses research funding for the health effects of low-dose radiation. From fiscal year 2012 through 2016, seven federal agencies collectively obligated $209.6 million for such research, with DOE and NIH accounting for most of the funding. However, the report notes that these agencies did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. The report concludes with a recommendation for the Secretary of Energy to lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing shared research priorities related to low-dose radiation health effects. However, DOE did not agree with this recommendation, citing that other agencies also have legal mandates", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

The report finds that CMS provided guidance to Medicare Part D plan sponsors in 2013, instructing them to implement a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system to monitor beneficiary opioid use. CMS also created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS) in 2013, which identifies high-risk opioid users based on criteria such as high dosage, multiple providers, and multiple pharmacies. The OMS generates quarterly reports for plan sponsors, who are expected to take appropriate action and respond to CMS within 30 days.\n\nActions taken by plan sponsors in response to the OMS reports include case management, point-of-sale edits, and investigations. Case management involves coordinating with providers to address potential harm to beneficiaries. Point-of-sale edits limit beneficiaries to certain opioids and amounts, and alert pharmacists when a prescription exceeds the limit. Investigations may be conducted by CMS's National Benefit Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (NBI MEDIC) or the plan sponsor's internal investigative unit, and may lead to referrals to law enforcement agencies or the HHS Office of Inspector General.\n\nThe report finds that CMS reported a 61% decrease from 2011 to 2016 in the number of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria for high-risk opioid use. However, the report also notes that CMS lacks information on beneficiaries who receive high opioid doses but do not meet the OMS criteria, as well as on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids.\n\nIn response to these findings, CMS revised its OMS criteria in 2018 to include more at-risk beneficiaries, and began to gather information from its patient safety measures on the number of beneficiaries using more than 120 mg MED of opioids for 90 days or longer. However, the report concludes that CMS lacks the necessary", "answers": ["Misuse of prescription opioids can lead to overdose and death. Medicare and Medicaid, two of the nation's largest health care programs, provide prescription drug coverage that can include opioids. GAO and others have reported on inappropriate activities and risks associated with these prescriptions. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report (GAO-18-15) and discusses (1) CMS oversight of Medicare beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions under Part D, and (2) CMS oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. For the October 2017 report, GAO reviewed CMS opioid utilization and prescriber data, CMS guidance for plan sponsors, and CMS's strategy to prevent opioid misuse. GAO also interviewed CMS officials, the six largest Part D plan sponsors, and 12 national associations selected to represent insurance plans, pharmacy benefit managers, physicians, patients, and regulatory and law enforcement authorities. In October 2017, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provided guidance on the monitoring of Medicare beneficiaries who received opioid prescriptions to plan sponsors—private organizations that implement the Medicare drug benefit, Part D—but it lacked information on most beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioid use. Specifically, GAO found that CMS provided guidance to plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and required them to implement drug utilization review systems that use criteria similar to CMS's. Prior to 2018, the agency's criteria focused on beneficiaries who did all the following: (1) received prescriptions of high doses of opioids, (2) received prescriptions from four or more providers, and (3) filled prescriptions at four or more pharmacies. According to CMS, this approach focused actions on beneficiaries the agency determined to have the highest risk of harm. For 2018, CMS revised the criteria to include more at-risk beneficiaries. CMS's criteria, including recent revisions, did not provide sufficient information about the larger population of potentially at-risk beneficiaries. CMS estimated that, in 2015, 727,016 beneficiaries would have received high doses of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies, but only 33,223 would have met its revised criteria. In 2016, CMS began to collect information on some of these beneficiaries using a higher dosage threshold for opioid use. However, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, CMS's approach also missed some who could be at risk of harm. As a result, CMS had limited information to assess progress against the goals of the Medicare and Medicaid programs' Opioid Misuse Strategy, which includes activities to reduce risk of harm to beneficiaries. CMS provided oversight on prescribing of drugs at high risk of abuse through a variety of projects, but did not analyze data specifically on opioids. According to CMS officials, CMS and plan sponsors identified providers who prescribed large amounts of drugs with a high risk of abuse, and those suspected of fraud or abuse may be referred to law enforcement. However, GAO found that CMS did not identify providers who may be inappropriately prescribing large amounts of opioids separately from other drugs, and did not require plan sponsors to report actions they take when they identified such providers. As a result, CMS lacked information that it could use to assess how opioid prescribing patterns are changing over time, and whether its efforts to reduce harm are effective. In the October 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations that CMS (1) gather information on the full number of at-risk beneficiaries receiving high doses of opioids, (2) identify providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and (3) require plan sponsors to report to CMS on actions related to providers who inappropriately prescribe opioids. HHS concurred with the first two recommendations, but not with the third.

In addition, the act established a Commission to review, among other things, the military selective service process and report on it. The act also included a provision for GAO to review DOD's procedures for evaluating selective service requirements. In this report, GAO compared the information DOD included in its report with the act's required elements and identified additional information that could benefit the Commission as it further reviews the military selective service process.

Specifically, DOD provided information on: 1. the direct and indirect benefits of the military selective service system; 2. the functions performed by the Selective Service System that would be assumed by DOD in the absence of a national registration system; 3. the systems, manpower, and facilities needed by DOD to physically mobilize inductees in the absence of the Selective Service System; 4. the feasibility and the utility of eliminating the focus on the mass mobilization of primarily combat troops in favor of a system that focuses on the mobilization of military occupational specialties, and the extent to which such a change would impact the need for both male and female inductees; 5.

GAO identified additional information that may benefit the Commission's ongoing evaluation of the military selective service process. The fifth required reporting element required DOD to analyze its personnel needs in the event of an emergency requiring mass mobilization and a timeline for obtaining these inductees. In response, DOD provided the personnel requirements and timeline that were developed in 1994 and that have not been updated since. DOD officials stated that they did not conduct additional analysis to update these requirements because the all-volunteer force is of adequate size and composition to meet DOD's personnel needs. In 2012, GAO recommended that DOD establish a process to periodically reevaluate DOD's requirements for the Selective Service System. Although DOD concurred with this recommendation, it has not yet implemented it. GAO believes this recommendation is still valid. Having updated DOD Selective Service System requirements and timelines for a potential draft may be useful in supporting the ongoing evaluation of the military selective service process by the Commission. Further, military service officials told GAO that their perspectives on how selective service processes that could affect them had not been solicited in the preparation of DOD's report. Since the military services are to receive, train and integrate the inductees; provide support to the Selective Service System during a national emergency; and could help identify critical skill sets needed to meet emerging demands and the impact a draft could have on meeting those demands, the military service officials' perspectives could be useful to the Commission. DOD officials stated that they are currently collecting these perspectives and plan to provide this information to the Commission. GAO is not making any new recommendations.

{"pred": "The report provides a historical overview of the distribution of federal highway assistance to states, primarily focusing on the use of formulas for apportioning funds. The first federal program to fund road construction in 1916 used three factors: land area, population, and rural postal road mileage, with each factor weighted equally. These factors were chosen to address disagreements between urban and rural interests and to allay constitutional concerns. The 1944 Federal-Aid Highway Act shifted the focus away from rural roads and created three separate highway systems: Primary, Secondary, and Urban. Each system was authorized a percentage of the total funds provided, which were then apportioned among the states by formula.\n\nThe report highlights the evolution of formula factors over time, with the 1970s and 1980s seeing the creation of many narrowly targeted programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) in 2012 eliminated or consolidated two-thirds of the federal highway programs and changed the way funds were apportioned among the states. The apportionment was based on each state's share of total apportionments in FY2012, the last year of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA).\n\nThe report also discusses the use of equity programs, which were designed to address concerns about fairness and ensure that states receiving less than their residents paid in highway taxes could be made whole. The MAP-21 formula guaranteed each state at least 95 cents of every dollar the state's highway users paid in taxes. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) in 2015 made only minor changes to the MAP-21 apportionment mechanism and retained the basic structure.\n\nThe report concludes by comparing each state's apportionment amounts under current law to various factors that have been used in the past, such as population, land area, and postal road mileage. It notes that the current apportionment mechanism is not based on any specific policy objectives and that some policy-related factors, such as states' rates of population growth and projected increases in truck traffic, have never been used as formula factors.", "answers": ["More than 90% of federal highway assistance is distributed to the states by formula.

Since enactment of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) in 2012, formula factors such as population and highway lane mileage have ceased to have a significant role in determining the distribution of funds. The apportionment among the states under the current surface transportation law, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94), passed in 2015, is not based on any particular policy objectives other than ensuring the stability of states' shares of total funding based on their shares in the last year of MAP-21, In addition, each state is guaranteed an amount at least equal to 95 cents on the dollar of the taxes paid by its residents into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund.

Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries.

The report notes that the success of the network depends on generating enough revenue to operate it over the long term and achieving user adoption, regardless of network reliability and security.\n\nLastly, the report highlights that FirstNet has taken steps to establish contract oversight mechanisms but has not fully assessed the staffing needs of its oversight workforce, particularly in the Network Program Office. The report recommends that FirstNet assess the long-term staffing needs in the Network Program Office prior to assuming full responsibility for administering the network contract, which FirstNet has agreed to address.\n\nIn conclusion, the report provides an overview of the progress made by FirstNet in establishing the network, the challenges faced, and the recommendations for improvement, particularly in addressing tribal concerns and staffing needs for contract oversight.", "answers": ["FirstNet is charged with establishing a nationwide public-safety broadband network that is reliable, secure, and interoperable. To inform this work, FirstNet is consulting with a variety of stakeholders. In March 2017, FirstNet awarded a 25-year contract to AT&T to build, operate, and maintain the network. FirstNet's oversight of AT&T's performance is important given the scope of the network and the duration of the contract. This testimony provides information on (1) FirstNet's efforts to establish the network; (2) stakeholder views on network reliability, security, and interoperability challenges FirstNet faces and its efforts to address them; and (3) FirstNet's plans to oversee its network contractor. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report ( GAO-17-569 ). For this report, GAO reviewed FirstNet documentation, key contract oversight practices identified in federal regulations and other sources, tribal communication practices identified by federal agencies, and assessed FirstNet's efforts and plans against these practices. GAO also interviewed FirstNet officials and a nongeneralizable selection of public safety, tribal, and other stakeholders selected to obtain a variety of viewpoints. In June 2017, GAO reported that the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) had conducted key efforts to establish the network, namely releasing the request for proposal (RFP) for the network and awarding the network contract to AT&T. As the contractor, AT&T will be responsible for the overall design, development, production, operation, and evolution of the network. Additionally, FirstNet consulted with state and local, federal, and tribal stakeholders. State officials GAO contacted were generally satisfied with FirstNet's efforts to engage them. However, tribal stakeholders GAO contacted expressed concern that FirstNet has not fully engaged in effective communication with tribes. FirstNet engaged tribes through a variety of mechanisms, such as through state points of contact and a working group, but tribes noted that individuals with first-hand knowledge of tribes' experiences are unable to represent tribal views directly among FirstNet's key decision makers. Although FirstNet is required to consult with tribes through state points of contact, a key principle of effective tribal communication is to seek full understanding of tribal concerns and reach consensus where possible. By fully exploring and proposing actions to address tribal stakeholders' concerns, FirstNet could help improve its relations with tribes and better meet stakeholders' needs. According to stakeholders GAO contacted, FirstNet faces various challenges to ensure the network's reliability, security, and interoperability. For example, stakeholders raised concerns related to: providing coverage to rural areas, in buildings, or underground; ensuring the network's overall resiliency and cybersecurity; and managing frameworks for user identity, credentialing of users, access management, and prioritization of users on the network. FirstNet has taken action to address these challenges, such as by opening a test lab to test public safety devices and applications before deploying them on the network. The majority of stakeholders GAO contacted were satisfied with FirstNet's efforts but many noted that much uncertainty remains about how the network will be implemented. FirstNet established offices to oversee its network contractor, developed policies and procedures to guide contract administration—including management and oversight—and is receiving assistance from another federal agency with contract administration experience, although FirstNet plans to assume full responsibility in the future. For example, FirstNet established the Network Program Office to oversee the contractor's performance and facilitate quality assurance of contract deliverables, among other things. Although this office will perform essential contract-administration functions, FirstNet had not conducted long-term projections of staffing needs for the office as of April 2017. As a result, FirstNet lacks reasonable assurance that it will have sufficient resources to handle increases in its responsibilities over time. Planning for and assigning adequate resources, including people, and assessing resource needs is a key practice for planning and executing effective contract oversight. By performing a long-term staffing assessment for the Network Program Office, FirstNet would be in a better position to fully understand its staffing needs and respond to staffing changes and risks as it assumes full responsibility of contract administration in the future.

One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects.

Light IBCTs can move by foot, by vehicle, or by air (either air landed or by helicopter). Airborne IBCTs are specially trained and equipped to conduct parachute assaults. Air Assault IBCTs are specially trained and equipped to conduct helicopter assaults. Currently, the Army contends IBCTs face a number of limitations The IBCT lacks the ability to decisively close with and destroy the enemy under restricted terrains such as mountains, littorals, jungles, subterranean areas, and urban areas to minimize excessive physical burdens imposed by organic material systems. The IBCT lacks the ability to maneuver and survive in close combat against hardened enemy fortifications, light armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel. IBCTs lack the support of a mobile protected firepower capability to apply immediate, lethal, long-range direct fires in the engagement of hardened enemy bunkers, light armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel in machine gun and sniper positions; with all-terrain mobility and scalable armor protection; capable of conducting operations in all environments. To address these limitations, the Army is undertaking three programs: the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)/Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), formerly known as the Ultra-Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV); the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV); and the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) programs. These programs would be based on vehicles that are commercially available. This approach serves to reduce costs and the time it takes to field combat vehicles. The GMV/ISV is intended to provide mobility to the rifle squad and company. The LRV would provide protection to the moving force by means of scouts, sensors, and a variety of medium-caliber weapons, and the MPF would offer the IBCT the capability to engage and destroy fortifications, bunkers, buildings, and light-to-medium armored vehicles more effectively. The FY2020 Army GMV budget request for $37 million in procurement funding supports the procurement of 69 GMVs for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and 15 ISVs for the Army. The FY2020 GMV Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) request is for $3 million to support operational testing. The Army did not submit a FY2020 budget request for the LRV program. The FY2020 Army MPF budget request for $310.152 million in RDT&E funding supports the continuation of rapid prototyping efforts and the completion of 24 prototypes.

The report found that the consolidation plans, finalized between 2006 and 2009, had not been updated to reflect changes in workplace standards, new development options, or leasing options. The report also noted that the funding for the St. Elizabeths project had not aligned with the initial plans, resulting in a funding gap of over $1.6 billion and schedule delays of over 10 years.\n\nThe report recommended that DHS and GSA conduct various assessments and analyses to inform updated DHS headquarters consolidation plans. However, as of April 2018, the agencies had not submitted updated plan information to Congress that addressed these recommendations. The report also found that the cost and schedule estimates for the St. Elizabeths project did not conform to leading practices, making the estimates unreliable. Specifically, the estimates did not include a life-cycle cost analysis, were not regularly updated, and did not include a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis.\n\nThe report recommended that DHS and GSA develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the remaining portions of the consolidation project in accordance with leading practices. As of April 2018, the agencies had not submitted revised estimates to Congress.

In September 2014, GAO issued a report entitled: Federal Real Property: DHS and GSA Need to Strengthen the Management of DHS Headquarters Consolidation (GAO-14-648). This statement summarizes the key findings and recommendations from this report, and provides a status update as of April 2018 on DHS and GSA implementation of GAO's recommendations. To complete the September 2014 report, GAO compared DHS and GSA capital planning efforts against applicable leading practices, interviewed officials, and reviewed cost and schedule estimates for the St. Elizabeths project. To assess subsequent DHS and GSA actions to implement GAO's September 2014 recommendations, GAO conducted periodic follow-up with agency officials. In its September 2014 report, GAO found that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and General Services Administration (GSA) planning for the DHS headquarters consolidation at the St. Elizabeths campus in Washington, D.C. did not fully conform with leading capital decision-making practices intended to help agencies effectively plan and procure assets. Specifically, GAO found that DHS and GSA had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs, identified capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives that would help officials adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and address funding issues as reflected in leading practices. GAO recommended that DHS and GSA conduct various assessments and analyses and use the results to inform updated DHS headquarters consolidation plans. The agencies concurred with this recommendation. In its September 2014 report, GAO also found that DHS and GSA cost and schedule estimates for the headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths did not conform or, only minimally or partially conformed, with leading estimating practices, and were therefore unreliable. Thus, GAO recommended that DHS and GSA develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the remaining portions of the consolidation project in accordance with leading practices, and the agencies concurred with this recommendation.

The majority of these beneficiaries are retired or disabled workers, with benefits determined by past earnings, age, and other factors. Beneficiaries include workers, their dependents, and survivors.\n\nTo be eligible for Social Security benefits, a person must have a sufficient history of earnings in employment subject to Social Security payroll taxes, earning one Quarter of Coverage (QC) for each $1,360 of earnings, up to four QCs per year. The number of QCs required for full insured status ranges from 6 to 40, depending on the worker's age and years of employment.\n\nBenefits are calculated using the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), which accounts for growth in overall economy-wide earnings. For retired workers, the AIME is the average of the 35 highest years of indexed earnings. For disabled workers, the number of computation years depends on the worker's age at the time of disability.\n\nThe primary insurance amount (PIA) is determined by applying a benefit formula to the AIME, with three brackets and three fixed factors (90%, 32%, and 15%).

In 2018, benefit outlays were approximately $989 billion, with roughly 63 million beneficiaries and 176 million workers in Social Security-covered employment. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035. Monthly benefit amounts are determined by federal law. Social Security is of ongoing interest both because of its role in supporting a large portion of the population and because of its long-term financial imbalance, and policymakers have considered numerous proposals to change its benefit computation rules. The Social Security benefits that are paid to worker beneficiaries and to workers' dependents and survivors are based on workers' past earnings. The computation process involves three main steps First, a summarized measure of lifetime earnings is computed. That measure is called the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Second, a benefit formula is applied to the AIME to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA). The benefit formula is progressive. As a result, workers with higher AIMEs receive higher Social Security benefits, but the benefits received by people with lower earnings replace a larger share of past earnings. Third, an adjustment may be made based on the age at which a beneficiary chooses to begin receiving payments. For retired workers who claim benefits at the full retirement age (FRA) and for disabled workers, the monthly benefit equals the PIA. Retired workers who claim earlier receive lower monthly benefits, and those who claim later receive higher benefits. Retired worker benefits can be affected by other adjustments. For example, the windfall elimination provision can reduce benefits for individuals who receive a pension from non-Social Security-covered earnings, and benefits can be withheld under the retirement earnings test if an individual continues to work and earns above a certain amount. Although not an adjustment, Social Security benefits can be subject to income tax, thereby affecting the beneficiary's net income. Benefits for eligible dependents and survivors are based on the worker's PIA. For example, a dependent spouse receives a benefit equal to 50% of the worker's PIA, and a widow(er) receives a benefit equal to 100% of the worker's PIA.

TSA officials at airports collect and report passenger throughput and wait times data daily, with TSA headquarters compiling the data through the Performance Measurement Information System. The TSA's Office of Security Operations (OSO) is responsible for allocating TSOs across airports, using a combination of data analysis and line-item adjustments.\n\nIn 2007, TSA implemented a plan to periodically assess the assumptions underlying the Resource Allocation Plan, including passenger and checked baggage screening rates. TSA headquarters officials have taken steps to improve communication with stakeholders, such as airlines and airports, through daily conference calls and presentations.

For its May 2018 report, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; and surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia. GAO also visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations, and analyzed meal site data from these 3 states. In addition, GAO interviewed USDA, state, and national organization officials, as well as SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016, according to GAO's May 2018 report. GAO noted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directed states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, GAO found that participation estimates had been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directed states to use would continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs helped feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed for its May 2018 report. For example, GAO found that in July 2016, about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allowed school meal providers to serve summer meals, according to USDA data. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with SFSP meal providers and national organizations indicated the reach of such efforts was limited. In GAO's May 2018 report, states and SFSP meal providers reported challenges with issues related to meal sites, participation, and program administration, though USDA, state, and local officials had taken some steps to address these issues. Seventeen states in GAO's survey and several providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites were in safe locations. To address this issue, USDA granted some states and providers flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, GAO found that USDA had not broadly communicated the circumstances it considered when granting this flexibility or reported to Congress on the use of flexibilities with respect to the on-site requirement in areas where safety was a concern, per requirements. As a result, neither USDA nor Congress knew whether these flexibilities were helping provide meals to children and meeting program goals. Further, officials from national and regional organizations GAO interviewed, as well as providers GAO visited, reported challenges related to the administrative burden associated with participating in multiple child nutrition programs. Although USDA had established program and policy simplifications to help lessen related burdens, the persistence of challenges in this area suggested that information had not reached all relevant state agencies, potentially limiting children's access to meals by discouraging provider participation. In its May 2018 report, GAO made four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP, communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery, evaluate and annually report to Congress on its use of waivers and demonstration projects when granting these flexibilities, and disseminate information about existing flexibilities available to streamline administrative requirements for providers participating in multiple child nutrition programs.

GAO was asked to review key characteristics of TCS programs. This report examines (1) state TCS programs' policies regarding student eligibility and scholarship awards, and (2) how donating to a TCS program could affect the amount of state and federal taxes owed by donors. For both objectives, GAO reviewed publicly-available documents about student eligibility and tax provisions for all 22 programs authorized as of January 2018 and verified the accuracy of the information with state program officials. GAO did not conduct an independent legal review of state laws and regulations. GAO also interviewed federal officials and reviewed relevant federal guidance and policy documents. In 2018, there were 22 tax credit scholarship (TCS) programs authorized across 18 states, which provide state tax credits for individual and business donations that fund scholarships for students to attend elementary and secondary private schools (see figure). To determine the eligibility of students for these scholarships, most TCS programs use household income and have various approaches to determine scholarship award amounts. Income limits vary widely among programs, ranging from approximately $32,000 to $136,500 per year for students from a four-person household in school year 2017-2018. Programs have different requirements for how students can use their scholarships and different methods for calculating scholarship amounts. More than half of the programs (13 of 22) allow students to use their scholarship money for costs like transportation and books in addition to tuition, whereas the remaining programs (9 of 22) require scholarships funds to be used for tuition only. Average scholarship awards in school year 2016-2017 ranged from $500 to $5,468 per student among the 16 programs that published or provided GAO with such information. The effect of TCS donations on donors' tax liability depends on program characteristics and donors' financial circumstances. Specifically, half of the 22 programs allow eligible donors to claim 100 percent of their donations as state tax credits, meaning that for each dollar donated, state taxes owed are reduced by a dollar, up to any maximum set by the state. The remaining 11 programs allow donors to claim from 50 to 85 percent of their donations as state tax credits.

The Coast Guard, a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lacks a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all necessary acquisitions to maintain current service levels within available resources. This lack of planning has resulted in delayed and reduced capabilities, unaddressed capability gaps, and deferred acquisitions.\n\nThe report recommends that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan, which should include an analysis of the current asset portfolio, performance gaps, and justifications for new acquisitions. The plan should also reflect acquisition trade-off decisions and their effects in the annual Capital Investment Plans. DHS agreed with this recommendation and plans to address it by March 2020.\n\nThe report also emphasizes the importance of a sound business case for each acquisition, which requires a balance between operator requirements and resources needed to transform the concept into a product. Key enablers of a good business case include firm, feasible requirements, stable designs, mature technologies, reliable cost estimates, and realistic schedules.\n\nThe report finds that the Coast Guard's polar icebreaker program lacked a sound business case due to risks in four key areas: technology readiness, cost estimates, schedule, and design. The Coast Guard intends to use proven technologies, but did not conduct a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies. The cost estimate for the program substantially met best practices but did not quantify the range of possible costs over the entire program lifecycle. The planned delivery dates were not informed by a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities and were primarily driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities. The Coast Guard set program baselines before conducting a preliminary design review, putting the program at risk of having an unstable design.\n\nThe report recommends that the Coast Guard, in collaboration with the Navy, revise the agreement to clarify how cost growth in the polar icebreaker program will be addressed. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation and plans to update the agreement by March 2019.\n\nThe report also discusses the use of contracting mechanisms such as multiyear contracting and block buy contracting, highlighting their potential benefits and risks. It stresses the importance of considering multiple factors such as estimated savings, stability of requirements, quantities required,", "answers": ["Both the Coast Guard—a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—and the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are investing significant resources to recapitalize their aging fleets of ships. Ensuring that the Coast Guard and NOAA maintain their ships and address potential capability gaps is vital for protecting national security and scientific interests. This statement summarizes lessons that GAO has identified from its prior reviews of Coast Guard and Navy acquisitions, which can be applied to the Coast Guard's and NOAA's shipbuilding efforts. Specifically, this testimony provides information on, among other things, (1) long-term strategic planning for acquisitions, (2) the need for a sound business case, and (3) the leveraging of the Navy's acquisition resources and shipbuilding expertise. In its prior work, GAO reviewed Coast Guard and Navy programs and interviewed officials. For this testimony, GAO obtained publicly available information on NOAA's ship acquisition efforts. GAO has found that acquisition programs can benefit from long-term strategic planning that identifies how tradeoff decisions would affect the future of the acquisition portfolio. In July 2018, GAO found the Coast Guard continues to manage its acquisitions through its annual budget process and the 5-year Capital Investment Plan. As a result of this planning process, the Coast Guard has continued to defer planned acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational capability gaps unaddressed. Incorporating the use of a long-term strategic plan and additional tradeoff discussion into the Capital Investment Plan could lead to more informed choices before irreversible commitments are made. GAO's prior work has also found that acquisition programs should start with solid business cases before setting program baselines and committing resources. At the heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach—successful shipbuilding programs build on attaining critical levels of knowledge at key points in the shipbuilding process before significant investments are made (see figure). In September 2018, GAO found the Coast Guard did not have this type of sound business case when it established the program baselines for its polar icebreaker program in March 2018 due to risks in technology, design, cost, and schedule. For example, the Coast Guard's planned delivery dates were not informed by a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities, but rather were primarily driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast Guard's only operating heavy polar icebreaker reaches the end of its service life. Agencies have partnered with the Navy to take advantage of its resources and shipbuilding expertise, including the Coast Guard when acquiring the polar icebreakers. For example, in September 2018, GAO found that the Coast Guard and the Navy had established an integrated program office and a ship design team. These teams provided input to Navy cost estimators, who developed the polar icebreaker program's cost estimate. GAO has previously recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan, reflect acquisition trade-off decisions in its annual Capital Investment Plans, and address risks to establish a sound business case for its polar icebreakers acquisition.

{"pred": "The October 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the efforts of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to monitor opioid overutilization among Medicare Part D beneficiaries. The report finds that CMS provides guidance to Medicare Part D plan sponsors on monitoring opioid overutilization, which includes implementing a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system and creating the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS) to identify high-risk opioid users. The OMS criteria, as of 2017, considered a beneficiary to be at high risk if they received a total daily Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED) greater than 120 mg for 90 consecutive days, received opioids from four or more providers in the previous 12 months, and received opioids from four or more pharmacies in the previous 12 months. The report notes that the criteria excluded beneficiaries with a cancer diagnosis or those in hospice care.\n\nThe report also outlines actions that plan sponsors may take when identifying high-risk beneficiaries, such as case management, beneficiary-specific point-of-sale (POS) edits, formulary-level POS edits, and referrals for investigation. The report states that CMS expects plan sponsors to share any information with CMS on beneficiaries they identify through their own DUR systems.\n\nThe report highlights that CMS has seen a decrease in the number of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria of high risk, from 29,404 in 2011 to 11,594 in 2016. However, it also notes that CMS does not have comparable information on beneficiaries who receive high opioid doses but do not meet the OMS criteria.\n\nIn response to this, CMS has revised its OMS criteria to include more at-risk beneficiaries, defining a high user as having an average daily MED greater than 90 mg for any duration, and who receives opioids from four or more providers and four or more pharmacies, or from six or more providers regardless of the number of pharmacies, for the prior 6 months. The report states that based on 2015", "answers": ["Misuse of prescription opioids can lead to overdose and death. In 2016, over 14 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries received opioid prescriptions, and spending for opioids was almost $4.1 billion. GAO and others have reported on inappropriate activities and risks associated with these prescriptions. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report (GAO-18-15) and discusses (1) CMS oversight of beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions under Part D, and (2) CMS oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. For the October 2017 report, GAO reviewed CMS opioid utilization and prescriber data, CMS guidance for plan sponsors, and CMS's strategy to prevent opioid misuse. GAO also interviewed CMS officials, the six largest Part D plan sponsors, and 12 national associations selected to represent insurance plans, pharmacy benefit managers, physicians, patients, and regulatory and law enforcement authorities. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides guidance on the monitoring of Medicare beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions to plan sponsors—private organizations that implement the Medicare drug benefit, Part D—but lacks information on most beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioid use. CMS provides guidance to plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and requires them to implement drug utilization review systems that use criteria similar to CMS's. CMS's criteria focused on beneficiaries who do all the following: (1) receive prescriptions of high doses of opioids, (2) receive prescriptions from four or more providers, and (3) fill prescriptions at four or more pharmacies. According to CMS, this approach focused actions on beneficiaries the agency determined to have the highest risk of harm. CMS's criteria, including recent revisions, do not provide sufficient information about the larger population of potentially at-risk beneficiaries. CMS estimates that while 33,223 beneficiaries would have met the revised criteria in 2015, 727,016 would have received high doses of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies. In 2016, CMS began to collect information on some of these beneficiaries using a higher dosage threshold for opioid use. This approach misses some who could be at risk of harm, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. As a result, CMS is limited in its ability to assess progress toward meeting the broader goals of its Opioid Misuse Strategy for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which includes activities to reduce the risk of harm to beneficiaries from opioid use. CMS oversees the prescribing of drugs at high risk of abuse through a variety of projects, but does not analyze data specifically on opioids. According to CMS officials, CMS and plan sponsors identify providers who prescribe large amounts of drugs with a high risk of abuse, and those suspected of fraud or abuse may be referred to law enforcement. However, GAO found that CMS does not identify providers who may be inappropriately prescribing large amounts of opioids separately from other drugs, and does not require plan sponsors to report actions they take when they identify such providers. As a result, CMS is lacking information that it could use to assess how opioid prescribing patterns are changing over time, and whether its efforts to reduce harm are effective. In the October 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations that CMS (1) gather information on the full number of at-risk beneficiaries receiving high doses of opioids, (2) identify providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and (3) require plan sponsors to report to CMS on actions related to providers who inappropriately prescribe opioids. HHS concurred with the first two recommendations, but not with the third.

Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process.

Additional programs focus on homelessness, HIV/AIDS housing, and disaster recovery. The report also discusses the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures mortgages for low-down payment borrowers and multifamily rental buildings.\n\nThe report provides an overview of the FY2019 appropriations process, which spanned two Congresses. The President's FY2019 budget request proposed a decrease in funding for HUD, with program eliminations such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), Public Housing Capital Funding, and Choice Neighborhoods grants. However, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees proposed funding for these programs at their prior-year levels, and the final FY2019 enacted funding level was higher than the President's budget request.\n\nOne of the main issues discussed in the report is the cost of renewing Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, which is the largest expense in the tenant-based rental assistance account.

On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress, including $41.4 billion in gross new budget authority for HUD (not accounting for savings from offsets or rescissions). That is about $11.3 billion (21.5%) less than was provided in FY2018. Most of that reduction ($7.7 billion) is attributable to proposed program eliminations, including Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), the HOME Investment Partnerships grant program, Public Housing Capital Funding, Choice Neighborhoods grants, and the programs funded in the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) account. On May 23, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of a FY2019 THUD appropriations bill ( H.R. 6072 ; H.Rept. 115-750 ), which proposed $53.2 billion in gross funding for HUD. This was about 29% more in gross funding than was requested by the President and slightly more (1%) than was provided in FY2018.

In 2010, there were 273 active burn pits in these regions, but by 2016, the number had decreased to two, with only one in Iraq and one in an unspecified location. The decline in the number of burn pits was attributed to the use of contractors for waste disposal and increased use of waste management alternatives such as landfills and incinerators. However, burn pits are still being used in some locations that are not military-operated.\n\nThe report highlights the potential health risks associated with burn pit emissions, as military and health professionals believe that exposure to these emissions may result in acute and chronic health effects for those exposed. Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have reported pulmonary and respiratory ailments, among other health concerns, that they attribute to burn pit emissions. Numerous veterans have also filed lawsuits against DOD contractors alleging that the mismanagement of burn pit operations resulted in exposure to harmful smoke and adverse health effects.\n\nThe report notes that establishing a correlation between environmental exposures and health issues can be difficult due to factors such as latency periods and multiple causes of exposure. In 2015, the Army published a study that evaluated the association between deployment to Iraq and Kuwait and the development of respiratory conditions post-deployment, but it was unable to identify a causal link between burn pit emissions and respiratory conditions.\n\nThe report states that the Department of Defense (DOD) had not fully assessed the health risks of burn pit use, citing a lack of adequate information on exposure levels and health impacts.

This statement provides information on the extent to which DOD has assessed any health risks of burn pit use. This statement is based on a GAO report issued in September 2016 (GAO-16-781). The report was conducted in response to section 313 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck” McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Specifically, GAO assessed the methodology DOD used in conducting a review of the compliance of the military departments and combatant commands with DOD instructions governing the use of burn pits in contingency operations and the adequacy of a DOD report for the defense committees. GAO also obtained updates from DOD on actions taken to assess health risks from burn pits since September 2016. GAO reported in September 2016 that the effects from exposing individuals to burn pit emissions were not well understood, and the Department of Defense (DOD) had not fully assessed the health risks associated with the use of burn pits. Burn pits—shallow excavations or surface features with berms used to conduct open-air burning—were often chosen as a method of waste disposal during recent contingency operations in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility, which extends from the Middle East to Central Asia and includes Iraq and Afghanistan. According to DOD Instruction 6055.01, DOD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program , DOD should apply risk-management strategies to eliminate occupational injury or illness and loss of mission capability or resources. The instruction also requires all DOD components to establish procedures to ensure that risk-acceptance decisions were documented, archived, and reevaluated on a recurring basis. Furthermore, DOD Instruction 6055.05, Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH), requires that hazards be identified and risk evaluated as early as possible, including the consideration of exposure patterns, duration, and rates. While DOD has guidance that applies to burn pit emissions among other health hazards, DOD had not fully assessed the health risks of use of burn pits, according to DOD officials. According to DOD officials, DOD's ability to assess these risks was limited by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to burn pit emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures had on individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD had not collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as required by its own guidance. Given the potential use of burn pits near installations and during future contingency operations, establishing processes to monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures would better position DOD and combatant commanders to collect data that could help assess exposure to risks. GAO recommended that the Secretary of Defense (1) take steps to ensure CENTCOM and other geographic combatant commands, as appropriate, establish processes to consistently monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures; and (2) in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, specifically examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure and potential long-term health-related issues. DOD concurred with the first recommendation and partially concurred with the second. In a May 2018 status update regarding these recommendations, DOD outlined a series of steps it had implemented as well as steps that it intends to implement. The department believes these efforts will further enhance its ability to better monitor burn-pit emissions and examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure and potential long-term health related issues.

The FCC's method of collecting data from broadband providers, which defines availability as the ability to offer service to at least one household in a census block, leads to overstatements of broadband availability on tribal lands. This is due to the counting of entire blocks as served even if only one location has broadband, and the inclusion of blocks where providers do not have any infrastructure connecting homes to their networks.\n\nThe report recommends that the FCC develop and implement methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands. This would help target federal broadband funding to areas that need it the most. The FCC agreed with this recommendation and stated that it is exploring options to collect more granular broadband deployment data.\n\nThe report also notes that the FCC lacks a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of the data. The FCC is missing an important source of information regarding areas where the data may overstate broadband service on tribal lands.

The report recommends that the FCC obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers to determine if it needs to clarify its tribal engagement guidance.\n\nThe report concludes by stating that partnerships between tribes and other entities to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands are not widespread due to the high costs associated with deploying broadband in rural and remote areas. The report finds that very little funding has gone directly to tribes and tribally owned broadband providers from four federal programs targeted to increase deployment in unserved areas from 2010 to 2017. The report recommends that the Rural Utilities Service identify any regulatory barriers that may unduly impede efforts by tribes to obtain RUS grant funds for broadband deployment on tribal lands.

Specifically, it addresses (1) the extent to which FCC’s approach to collecting broadband availability data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands, (2) the extent to which FCC obtains tribal input on the data, (3) partnerships tribes have formed with entities to deploy broadband infrastructure on tribal lands, and (4) barriers tribes face in obtaining federal funding. For these reports, GAO analyzed FCC and RUS data, and interviewed agency officials as well as a non-generalizable sample of stakeholders representing tribes and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) approach to collecting data on broadband availability causes it to overstate broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. In FCC’s approach, broadband is considered to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access on tribal lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. Most of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed stated FCC should work more directly with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC’s data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments could help improve the accuracy of FCC’s broadband data for tribal lands. Tribes have formed partnerships with different types of entities to deploy broadband infrastructure on tribal lands, but such partnerships are not widespread. The partnerships GAO identified included private providers, a community access network provider, an electric cooperative, a regional consortium, and tribally owned broadband providers. GAO reviewed four federal programs to deploy broadband services and found that from 2010 to 2017, less than 1 percent of funding has gone directly to tribes or tribally owned providers. The tribal entities GAO contacted cited barriers to obtaining funds from the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) grant funding, such as preparing network design, demonstrating financial sustainability of the broadband project within 5 years, and obtaining matching funds required to apply for federal grants. However, according to RUS officials, RUS has not taken steps to identify or address the barriers tribes face when applying for RUS grant funding due to limited resources and multiple competing priorities for those resources. By identifying and addressing regulatory barriers that may impede tribal entities’ access to RUS funding, RUS could help tribes obtain funding to expand broadband deployment on tribal lands.

The FRA was initially 65 when the program began in the 1930s but has been gradually increasing due to legislation enacted in 1983, reaching 67 for individuals born in 1960 or later. Workers can claim benefits as early as 62, but doing so results in a permanent reduction in benefits, with a larger reduction the earlier benefits are claimed. Conversely, claiming benefits after the FRA results in a permanent increase in benefits, with the increase decreasing as the age of claiming benefits increases.\n\nThe report also discusses the retirement earnings test (RET), which withholds Social Security benefits for individuals below the FRA who have earnings above certain thresholds. The thresholds are lower for individuals who will not reach the FRA during the year and higher for those who will. The RET no longer applies once the individual reaches the FRA.\n\nThe report provides tables showing the actuarial reduction applied to benefits based on the FRA and the age at which benefits are claimed, as well as the delayed retirement credit (DRC) that increases benefits for those claiming benefits after the FRA. The DRC has been modified over the years, with the current rate of 8% per year for individuals born in 1943 or later. The maximum age at which the DRC applies has also been lowered from 72 to 70.\n\nThe report notes that a majority of retired-worker beneficiaries claim benefits before the FRA, with 37% claiming benefits at age 62 and 64% under the age of 66 in 2017. The percentage of beneficiaries claiming benefits at earlier ages has declined in recent years.\n\nThe report also discusses proposals to increase the FRA and the early eligibility age (EEA) to address Social Security's long-range funding shortfall, such as the S.O.S. Act of 2016, which proposes increasing the FRA to 69 by 2034, and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform's recommendation to increase both the EEA and FRA, with the FRA reaching 68 by about ", "answers": ["The Social Security full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which workers can first claim full Social Security retired-worker benefits. Among other factors, a worker's monthly benefit amount is affected by the age at which he or she claims benefits relative to the FRA. Benefit adjustments are made based on the number of months before or after the FRA the worker claims benefits. The adjustments are intended to provide the worker with roughly the same total lifetime benefits, regardless of when he or she claims benefits, based on average life expectancy. Claiming benefits before the FRA results in a permanent reduction in monthly benefits (to take into account the longer expected period of benefit receipt); claiming benefits after the FRA results in a permanent increase in monthly benefits (to take into account the shorter expected period of benefit receipt). The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security in the 1930s. Under legislation enacted in 1983, the FRA is increasing gradually from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period (for those reaching age 62 between 2000 and 2022). The FRA will reach 67 for workers born in 1960 or later (i.e., for workers who become eligible for retirement benefits at age 62 in 2022). Currently, the FRA is 66 and 6 months for workers who become eligible for retirement benefits in 2019 (i.e., workers born in 1957). Workers can claim reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62 (the early eligibility age). Spouses can also claim reduced retirement benefits starting at age 62. Other dependents, such as widow(er)s, can claim benefits at earlier ages. For workers with an FRA of 66, for example, claiming benefits at age 62 results in a 25% reduction in monthly benefits. For workers with an FRA of 67, claiming benefits at age 62 results in a 30% benefit reduction. A majority of retired-worker beneficiaries claim benefits before the FRA. In 2017, 37% of new retired-worker beneficiaries were age 62; almost two-thirds (64%) were under the age of 66. Workers who delay claiming benefits until after the FRA receive a delayed retirement credit, which applies up to the age of 70. For workers with an FRA of 66, for example, claiming benefits at age 70 results in a 32% increase in monthly benefits. For workers with an FRA of 67, claiming benefits at age 70 results in a 24% benefit increase. In 2017, almost one-fourth (23%) of new retired-worker beneficiaries were age 66; 12% were over the age of 66. Some lawmakers have called for increasing the Social Security retirement age in response to the system's projected financial imbalance, citing gains in life expectancy for the population overall. Other lawmakers, however, express concern that increasing the retirement age would disproportionately affect certain groups within the population, citing differences in life expectancy by socioeconomic groups. Differential gains in life expectancy are important in the context of Social Security because the actuarial adjustments for claiming benefits before or after the full retirement age are based on average life expectancy. Proposals to increase the retirement age are also met with concerns about the resulting hardship for certain workers, such as those in physically demanding occupations, who may be unable to work until older ages and may not qualify for Social Security disability benefits.

Cobra Dane, located at Shemya Island, Alaska, is a significant contributor to DOD's ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence-gathering missions.\n\nCobra Dane, along with other radar systems, can track, classify, and discriminate missile threats, providing crucial information for interception. However, it does not currently have the capability to determine if a missile threat has been successfully intercepted. This capability is expected to be added through software changes, but it is unlikely to be implemented before 2025.\n\nThe report also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of locating the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska, over Cobra Dane's location at Shemya Island. LRDR, once operational, will provide unique capabilities such as real-time discrimination of missile threats and tracking of missile threats later in their trajectories.\n\nThe report notes that other radar investments, such as the Pacific Radar and Space Fence, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane for ballistic missile defense and space surveillance in the future. The Pacific Radar is expected to provide additional tracking capabilities, while the Space Fence is expected to provide the same capabilities as Cobra Dane.\n\nThe report also discusses the operational availability of Cobra Dane, which has declined slightly in recent years due to scheduled downtime and a single instance of unscheduled downtime.

Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island.

The report highlights that TANF funding is a combination of federal and state funds, with $16.5 billion in federal grants to states in FY2018. The report also notes that additional legislation is required to pay TANF grants in the final quarter of FY2019.\n\nThe report breaks down the uses of federal TANF grants and state Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funds in FY2017. Basic assistance, child care, work-related activities, and state refundable tax credits were the largest spending categories, accounting for 65% of total TANF and MOE funds. TANF also contributes significantly to the child welfare system, child prekindergarten programs, and various social services.\n\nThe report also discusses the unspent TANF funds, with $5.1 billion remaining unspent at the end of FY2017. However, some of these funds represent commitments to be spent later. The report also notes that the federal reporting requirements may undercount the number of families receiving any TANF-funded benefit or service due to focusing on families receiving ongoing assistance.\n\nThe report provides assistance caseload information, showing that 1.2 million families received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018, with 3.1 million recipients, mostly children.

TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard.

The report finds that there is a lack of clear policies defining responsibilities for internal communication of such incidents to M/PRI, potentially leading to delays in initiating the ARB process.\n\nThe report uses the example of incidents in Cuba in 2017 to illustrate this issue. U.S. embassy and State officials responded to these incidents, but M/PRI only became aware of them in August 2017, after media reports, due to a lack of clear communication channels. This delay in awareness may have resulted in a delay in initiating the ARB process.\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of State should revise State's policies to define responsibilities for internal communication of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or property damage at U.S. missions abroad. This revision is intended to ensure that M/PRI can initiate the ARB process in a timely manner, thereby improving the security programs and practices at U.S. missions abroad.

Over State has reported that over 20 U.S. diplomats and family members in Havana have suffered from medical conditions believed to be connected to the incidents, which began in late 2016 and have continued into 2017. By law, State is generally required to convene an ARB within 1260 days of incidents that result in serious injury at, or related to, a U.S. mission abroad, but the Secretary of State can determine that a 60 day extension is necessary. According to State's policy, M/PRI is responsible for initiating and leading State's ARB incident vetting process. This report is part of a broader request to review State's response to the incidents in Cuba. In this report, GAO examines the extent to which State's ARB policy ensures that M/PRI is made aware of incidents that may meet the ARB statute criteria. GAO analyzed relevant federal laws, State policies, and other State documents. GAO also interviewed cognizant State officials. The Department of State's (State) Accountability Review Board (ARB) policy does not ensure that the responsible office—State's Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing, and Innovation (M/PRI)—is made aware of incidents that may meet the ARB statute criteria, such as those that occurred in Cuba and were associated with injuries to U.S. personnel. According to State policy, as soon as M/PRI becomes aware of potentially qualifying incidents, M/PRI will start the process for considering whether the incident warrants an ARB. M/PRI relies on informal communication to identify potentially qualifying incidents to begin the vetting process because State does not have a policy, procedure, or process for internal communication of such incidents to M/PRI, according to State officials and GAO analysis. As illustrated in the figure below, other State entities began responding to the incidents in early 2017, but M/PRI was not made aware of the incidents until mid-August 2017, when a former M/PRI official contacted the office after seeing media reports. If M/PRI is not aware of incidents, it cannot initiate State's ARB incident vetting process. This situation puts State at risk of not meeting statutory time frames for convening an ARB and could result in State being less able to improve security programs and practices at other U.S. diplomatic posts.

{"pred": "The report, prepared by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), provides an analysis of the Coast Guard's decision to terminate the Integrated Health Information System (IHiS) project in October 2015. The termination was due to financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks. Financial risks arose from potential Antideficiency Act violations related to incorrect funding sources and fiscal year funds for the IHiS project. Technical risks included the lack of an independent security assessment, incomplete interfaces, and unfinished key functionalities. Schedule risks were due to concerns about the system's readiness for piloting in fall 2015. Personnel risks stemmed from changes in project management personnel and unclear decision-making processes.\n\nThe report also highlights the Coast Guard's inability to effectively manage and oversee the IHiS project, as evidenced by the lack of documentation and adherence to established System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices. The Coast Guard obligated approximately $67 million for the project between September 2010 and August 2017, with $6.6 million paid to vendors between November 2017 and February 2018 for services such as leased equipment, software licensing, and data storage.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges faced by clinics and sick bays in managing paper health records, including incomplete records, illegible handwriting, difficulty tracking medications, and time-consuming processes. These challenges are likely to persist until a new Electronic Health Record Acquisition (eHRa) system is successfully implemented.\n\nThe Coast Guard has initiated steps towards acquiring a new EHR system, with the plan to use the Non-Major Acquisition Process (NMAP) and establish project governance boards that include the Chief Information Officer. The report concludes with four recommendations to the Coast Guard, including expediting the acquisition of a new EHR, ensuring established processes are effectively implemented, establishing project governance boards, and documenting and sharing lessons learned from the discontinued IHiS project. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with these recommendations.", "answers": ["In 2010, the Coast Guard initiated an effort—known as IHiS—to replace its aging EHR system with a new system that was to modernize various health care services for its nearly 50,000 military members. However, in October 2015, the Coast Guard announced that the modernization project would be canceled. GAO was asked to summarize its report that is being released today on the Coast Guard's actions related to its EHR modernization initiative. GAO's testimony specifically addresses Coast Guard's (1) reasons for deciding to terminate further IHiS development; (2) management and oversight actions for the discontinued project and whether lessons learned were identified; (3) current process for managing health records and the challenges it is encountering; and (4) plans for effectively implementing a new EHR system and the current status of its efforts. In preparing the report on which this testimony is based, GAO reviewed IHiS project expenditures; analyzed key project management documentation; surveyed Coast Guard's Regional Managers and clinical staff; and interviewed key staff. Financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks led to the United States Coast Guard's (Coast Guard) decision to terminate the Integrated Health Information System (IHiS) project in 2015. According to the Coast Guard (a military service within the Department of Homeland Security), as of August 2017, $59.9 million was spent on the project over nearly 7 years and no equipment or software could be reused for future efforts. In addition, the Coast Guard could not fully demonstrate the project management actions taken for IHiS, lacked governance mechanisms, and did not document lessons learned for the failed project. In the absence of an electronic health record (EHR) system, the Coast Guard currently relies on a predominately paper health record management process to document health care services. Currently, the Coast Guard's clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each paper health record. Coast Guard Regional Managers and clinic and sick bay administrators informed GAO of the many challenges encountered in returning to a paper process. These challenges include the inability for some clinics to adequately track vital information such as medications—potentially causing harm to members if they take medications that have dangerous interactions. To help alleviate several of these challenges, the Coast Guard has developed alternative work-around processes. However, these alternative processes may not provide sustained solutions to overcoming these challenges. In February 2016, the Coast Guard initiated the process for acquiring a new EHR system. As of November 2017, agency officials had conducted research and recommended a solution based on performance, risk, cost, and schedule advantages. However, 2 years after canceling IHiS and moving toward a predominately manual process, the agency has not yet made a final determination on this. Successfully and quickly implementing an EHR system is vital to overcoming the challenges the Coast Guard currently faces in managing paper health records. The expeditious implementation of such a system can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of care to the thousands of Coast Guard active duty and reserve members that receive health care. In the report being released today, GAO is recommending that the Coast Guard (1) expeditiously and judiciously pursue a new EHR system, and in doing so (2) ensure key processes are implemented; (3) establish project governance boards; and (4) document lessons learned from the IHiS project.

The SHSP supports states and territories in implementing homeland security strategies, while the UASI addresses the unique needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas.\n\nThe report highlights concerns regarding the coordination of grant management between FEMA's headquarters and regional offices. Since 2009, assessments have recommended that regional offices should manage and monitor preparedness grants to avoid confusion and duplication, and to strengthen coordination with state and local grantees. However, FEMA decided to maintain a hybrid grant management structure, sharing responsibilities between headquarters and regions, citing concerns about costs and inconsistent program implementation.\n\nThe report also addresses the need for improved coordination among multiple preparedness grant programs, as these programs share similar goals, fund similar projects, and provide funds in the same geographic regions.

This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from March 2011 through February 2016 and selected updates conducted in December 2017 through April 2018. To conduct the prior work and updates, GAO analyzed relevant FEMA data and documentation and interviewed relevant officials. In February 2012, GAO identified coordination challenges among Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant programs that share similar goals and fund similar projects, which contribute to the risk of duplication among the programs. GAO recommended that FEMA take steps, as it develops its new grant management system, to collect project information with sufficient detail to identify potential duplication among the grant programs. FEMA has since addressed these recommendations. Specifically, in 2014, FEMA modified a legacy grants data system to capture more robust grant project-level data, and in fiscal year 2017, procured a software tool and developed a set of standard operating procedures to assist its staff in identifying potentially duplicative projects. These actions should help FEMA strengthen the administration and oversight of its grant programs. Furthermore, FEMA is also developing a new grants management modernization system to consolidate and better manage its grants. GAO is currently reviewing the system for this Committee and will report out next year. GAO reported in March 2011 on the need for FEMA to improve its oversight of preparedness grants by establishing a framework with measurable performance objectives for assessing urban area, state, territory, and tribal capabilities to identify gaps and prioritize investments. Specifically, GAO recommended that FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding. FEMA has taken some steps to address GAO's prior recommendation. Specifically, in February 2018, FEMA reported developing capability-specific performance objectives that will enable a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps. However, FEMA plans to finalize these efforts in 2020 and it is too early to tell how this will impact grant allocations.

The current array of incentives for alternative fuels and related technologies does not reflect a single, comprehensive strategy, but rather an aggregative approach to a range of discrete public policy issues, including goals of reducing petroleum consumption and import dependence, improving environmental quality, expanding domestic manufacturing, and promoting agriculture and rural development. Current federal programs are administered by five key agencies: Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The incentives and programs described in this report are organized by the responsible agency. Treasury (through the Internal Revenue Service, IRS) administers tax credits and deductions for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle purchases, expansion of alternative fuel refueling infrastructure, and incentives for the production and/or distribution of alternative fuels. Many of these incentives have expired in recent years.

The key findings are as follows:\n\n1. The number of Native American youth in federal and state/local justice systems declined across all phases (arrest, adjudication, and confinement) from 2010 to 2016. At the federal level, arrests dropped from 60 in 2010 to 20 in 2016, while at the state and local level, arrests decreased by almost 40%.\n\n2. The majority of Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems, not the federal system. For example, from 2010 to 2016, there were 105,487 arrests of Native American youth reported by state and local law enforcement agencies (LEAs), compared to 246 Native American youth held in federal custody by the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\n3. The types of offenses that Native American youth and non-Native American youth were arrested, adjudicated, and confined for were generally similar in state and local systems. However, there were differences in the federal system. For example, the majority of Native American youth in the federal system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses being assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of non-Native American youth in the federal system were involved in public order or drug and alcohol offenses.\n\n4. The percentage of Native American youth involved in most state and local systems was generally similar to their representation in those states' populations. The largest number of arrests by state and local LEAs occurred in Arizona and South Dakota in 2016.\n\n5. The representation of Native American youth in the federal system was higher than their representation in the nationwide population, due to federal government jurisdiction over certain crimes in Indian country, as well as the underfunding and capacity limitations of tribal justice systems.\n\n6.

During this period, state and local arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent from 18,295 in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016. The vast majority of Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems rather than the federal system. However, more Native American youth were involved in the federal system than their percentage in the nationwide population (1.6 percent). For example, of all youth arrested by federal entities during the period, 18 percent were Native American. According to Department of Justice (DOJ) officials, this is due to federal jurisdiction over certain crimes involving Native Americans. Comprehensive data on Native American youth involvement in tribal justice systems were not available for analysis. GAO's analysis showed several differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, the majority of Native American youths' involvement was for offenses against a person, such as assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of non-Native American youths' involvement was for public order offenses (e.g., immigration violations) or drug or alcohol offenses. On the other hand, in state and local justice systems, the involvement of Native American and non-Native American youth showed many similarities, such as similar offenses for each group.

While M-113s no longer serve as infantry fighting vehicles, five variants of the M-113 are used as command and control vehicles, general purpose vehicles, mortar carriers, and medical treatment and evacuation vehicles. The AMPV is intended to be a nondevelopmental program (candidate vehicles will be either existing vehicles or modified existing vehicles—not vehicles that are specially designed and not currently in service). Some suggest a nondevelopmental vehicle might make it easier for the Army to eventually field this system to the force, as most of the Army's past developmental programs, such as the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), the Future Combat System (FCS), the Crusader self-propelled artillery system, and the Comanche helicopter, were cancelled before they could be fully developed and fielded. On November 26, 2013, the Army issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the AMPV. This RFP stipulated the Army planned to award a five-year Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in May 2014 worth $458 million to a single contractor for 29 prototypes. While the March 2013 RFP established an Average Unit Manufacturing Cost Ceiling for each AMPV at $1.8 million, this was rescinded to permit vendors greater flexibility. The EMD phase was scheduled to run between FY2015 and FY2019, followed by three years of low-rate initial production (LRIP) starting in 2020. As of 2018, the Army planned to procure 2,936 AMPVs to replace M-113s in ABCTs. The Army also has plans to replace 1,922 M-113s at Echelons Above Brigade (EAB), and the Department of Defense (DOD) estimates that if the M-113s are replaced by AMPVs at EAB, total program costs could be increased by an additional $6.5 billion. While the Army would like a pure fleet of AMPVs, budgetary constraints could preclude this. On December 23, 2014, the Army announced it had selected BAE Systems Land and Armaments L.P. as the winner of the EMD contract. The initial award was for 52 months, valued at about $382 million. In addition, the award provided for an optional low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase. The EMD contract did not include EAB AMPV variants. The AMPV reportedly successfully completed its Critical Design Review (CDR) on June 23, 2016. On December 15, 2016, BAE delivered the first general purpose AMPV to the Army for testing. In September 2017, the Army began AMPV reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing. Also in 2017, based on budgetary constraints, the Army decided it would upgrade a number of EAB M-113s instead of replacing them with AMPVs. In May 2018, the Army decided to put the EAB M-113 upgrade effort on hold.

{"pred": "The report provides an overview of the three service classifications within the U.S. federal government: competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service (SES). The competitive service, the largest of the three, consists of civil service positions in the executive branch, except for those specifically excepted or appointed by the President or Senate. The competitive service follows a merit-based hiring process, with applicants competing for positions and being evaluated based on objective standards. The excepted service includes positions that are not in the competitive service or SES, and may be designated by statute or OPM. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within federal agencies.\n\nThe competitive service includes various types of appointments, such as continuing, term, and temporary positions. Employees in the competitive service are generally paid according to the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates, and have notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. The excepted service also includes various types of positions, categorized into schedules A, B, C, and D, and employees in the excepted service maintain the same notice and appeal rights as those in the competitive service, with some exceptions.\n\nThe SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. SES positions are generally managerial or supervisory roles that are classified above the GS-15 grade. The SES consists of career appointees, noncareer appointees, limited term appointees, and limited emergency appointees. Career appointees are chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, while noncareer appointees are not subject to the competitive selection process but must meet the qualifications of the SES position.\n\nThe SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service, with pay rates based on individual performance or contribution to agency performance. The SES also has a unique performance appraisal system, with OPM maintaining a certification process for these systems. SES members may be removed or subject to adverse actions for specified reasons, and have notice and appeal rights, with some exceptions for noncareer and limited term appointees.\n\nThe report also discusses special removal requirements for SES career appointees employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as a result of concerns about performance and accountability. The ", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3383}

GAO's previous work has found that growth in both the number of grant programs and level of funding has increased the diversity of federal grants to state and local governments. GAO's work has also found that designing and implementing grants management policies that strike an appropriate balance between ensuring accountability for the proper use of federal funds without increasing the complexity and cost of grants administration for agencies and grantees presents a governance challenge. At the same time, several government-wide initiatives hold promise for advancing the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of federal grants. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports on federal grants management and crosscutting issues related to managing for results across the federal government issued between 2005 and 2018. It addresses: (1) GAO's observations on long-standing challenges for federal grants management, and (2) opportunities to effectively advance current grant modernization initiatives. GAO has identified challenges to federal grants management in its work spanning several decades. These challenges include: Streamlining: Grants management requirements that are duplicative, unnecessarily burdensome, and conflicting require agencies to direct resources toward meeting them and can burden recipients of federal grants. GAO has reported on initiatives to streamline these requirements and address challenges grantees encounter throughout the grants lifecycle. Transparency: The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) required the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the Treasury, and other federal agencies to increase the types of information available on federal spending, including grants. GAO has reported on progress in standardizing and expanding reported data, but has found inconsistencies with the completeness and quality of the reported information. Collaboration and consultation: Collaboration, particularly information sharing, is an important factor in effective grants management. GAO's work on interagency grants management reform initiatives found that inadequate ongoing communication with grantees sometimes resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of initiatives. Duplication, overlap, and fragmentation : Agencies' grants management practices, such as requirements to avoid duplication and overlap among grants before awarding them, can help agencies achieve cost savings and result in greater efficiencies in grant programs. Internal controls and oversight : GAO's work has identified weaknesses in grants oversight and accountability. For example, GAO has identified opportunities for agencies to more consistently close out grants when the grantee's period of performance has ended to ensure that grantees have met all requirements and identified opportunities to redirect or return unused funds. Recent and proposed initiatives aimed at grants management reform present opportunities to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of federal grants. GAO's work on federal grants management and managing for results has highlighted a number of key features for effectively implementing such crosscutting initiatives, which include: (1) establishing implementation goals and tracking progress, (2) identifying and agreeing on leadership roles and responsibilities, and (3) developing an effective communication strategy. Further, given the number and diversity of grantor agencies and grant programs, it is important that any grant reform initiative integrate with other government-wide reform efforts on related issues across government, such as the grants-related Cross-Agency Priority goal, implementation of the DATA Act, and initiatives related to evidence-based policy. These efforts can be effective if they complement each other rather than run the risk of operating independently and potentially duplicating effort or working at cross-purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3880}

The Impoundment Control Act requires the President to notify Congress if an agency wants to withhold the obligation of funds. GAO has separately informed Congress of an impoundment of $91 million in funds that were not allocated to any financial assistance awards, and was not related to DOE's review process. According to the 10 ARPA-E project selectees GAO interviewed, DOE's financial assistance review process created uncertainty, which led to a variety of project impacts. The impacts most commonly cited by selectees included potentially delayed project timelines, as well as difficulties in staffing their project teams, among other impacts as shown below. DOE officials GAO interviewed said that they are reviewing DOE financial assistance in fiscal year 2018. DOE officials said that a key benefit of the fiscal year 2017 review process was an opportunity to better identify and coordinate future financial assistance department-wide on crosscutting issues. However, DOE plans to review fiscal year 2018 financial assistance prior to issuing funding opportunity announcements to the public, and thus before any recipients apply or are selected. As a result, DOE officials said, the uncertainty that ARPA-E selectees experienced during the fiscal year 2017 review process should be reduced. GAO is not making any recommendations. DOE provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3891}
{"pred": "The report provides an overview of four inter-American organizations: the Organization of American States (OAS), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and Pan American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH). These organizations, each with distinct areas of focus, are primarily funded by member states' assessed contributions based on their relative economic size, as determined by the OAS. The United States, being the largest contributor, currently pays over 50% of the total assessed contributions.\n\nIn 2013, the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act was enacted, aiming to reduce the United States' share of assessed contributions and establish a quota structure where no member state pays more than 50% of the OAS's assessed fees. The report notes that a proposal to modify the quota structure has been drafted, with potential implementation in 2019.\n\nThe report also highlights that the U.S. State, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Agriculture departments, as well as the USDA, provide voluntary contributions to these organizations through grants and cooperative agreements. From 2014 to 2016, the United States provided approximately $105 million in voluntary contributions.\n\nThe report identifies a need for improvement in the monitoring of these agreements, as U.S. agencies did not consistently include all required monitoring provisions or fully document the required monitoring activities. The report recommends that U.S. agencies ensure the inclusion of all monitoring provisions in their agreements and fully document the results of monitoring activities. The agencies have concurred with these recommendations and plan to take corrective action.\n\nLastly, the report states that the strategic goals of these inter-American organizations are generally aligned with the high-level strategic goals of the United States, and U.S. agencies consider U.S. strategic goals when deciding which projects to fund. The report concludes by emphasizing the importance of effective monitoring and documentation to ensure the appropriate and effective use of federal funds.", "answers": ["The United States belongs to several inter-American organizations, including the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH, which promote democracy, security, health care, agricultural development, and scientific exchange in the Western Hemisphere. The United States helps finance these organizations' operating expenses through assessed contributions. The United States also provides voluntary contributions through the federal funding of assistance agreements to OAS, PAHO, and IICA. This testimony is based on GAO's June and December 2017 reports that, among other things, (1) determined the amounts and percentages of U.S. assessed contributions to the four organizations, (2) assessed the extent to which U.S. agencies included and documented key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements, and (3) assessed the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, HHS, USAID, USDA, and the four organizations. GAO analyzed the four organizations' audited financial reports and a nongeneralizable sample of 12 assistance agreements awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA active in calendar years 2014 through 2016. While the United States' assessed contributions constituted over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to four inter-American organizations from 2014 to 2016, the U.S. share may be reduced in the near future (see table). In response to a statutory requirement, the U.S. Department of State (State) said it submitted to Congress a strategy that included working with the Organization of American States (OAS) member states toward ensuring that the OAS would not assess any single member state a contribution amounting to more than 50 percent of all OAS assessed contributions. At the OAS General Assembly in June 2017, OAS member states voted to draft a proposal to modify its system for determining member states' assessed contributions to potentially reduce the maximum assessed contribution to below 50 percent. The other three organizations use OAS's system for setting assessed contributions. Hence, any change in contributions at OAS should also be reflected at Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH). State, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide voluntary contributions to OAS, PAHO, and IICA in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements). In December 2017, GAO reported that its review of 12 such agreements across the four agencies found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. State has since taken corrective action. GAO also found that all four U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed. For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities, and USAID did not have full documentation of 2 of its 11 required activities. State and HHS said they initiated corrective action before our review. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. GAO found that the strategic goals of the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of State, USAID, HHS, and USDA. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that assistance agreements with these organizations align with U.S. goals. In its December 2017 report, GAO recommended that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities. USDA and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2710}
