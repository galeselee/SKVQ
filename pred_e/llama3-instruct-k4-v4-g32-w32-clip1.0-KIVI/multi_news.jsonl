The report, which took four years to complete and cost $40 million, is said to be a scathing indictment of the program, which involved the use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists.\n\nThe committee, led by Senator Mark Udall, has urged President Barack Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report, citing the importance of transparency and accountability. However, the CIA has disputed some of the report's findings and has refused to release the document, citing executive privilege.\n\nThe dispute has escalated to the point where the CIA Inspector General's Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the agency, including the monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the report.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish's blood from freezing, but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals around with them for most of their lives, which could be detrimental to their health.\n\nResearchers have found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has been observed in controlled settings, but this is the first time it has been found in nature.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the fish may have evolved a mechanism to clear the ice crystals from their circulation, but the long-term cost of having these proteins is still unknown. The researchers are unsure whether the fish can tolerate the presence of ice crystals in their bodies or if it has any adverse effects on their health.\n\nThe discovery provides new insights into the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the trade-offs that come with them. It also highlights the complexity of the fish's adaptation to their freezing environment and the need for further research to understand the long-term consequences of this adaptation.\n\nIn summary, the study reveals that the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish have a paradoxical effect, preventing the fish's blood from freezing while also inhibiting the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies.

These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, not only prevent their blood from freezing but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals with them for most of their lives, which could be detrimental to their health.\n\nThe study found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has significant implications for our understanding of the", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

{"pred": "The Pacific coast of North America is home to a vibrant and diverse marine ecosystem, which is largely dependent on the presence of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently in a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The decline is causing concern among scientists and conservation groups, as it is affecting not only the sardine fishery but also the populations of other marine species that rely on sardines as a food source.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and is being urged to take action to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean. Specifically, the PFMC is being asked to set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and to fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe decline of the sardine population is attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. This has repelled sardines, leading to a 72% decline in the population since its last peak in 2006. The decline has also led to a decrease in spawning, and federal fishery managers have slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds.\n\nConservation groups are urging the PFMC to halt sardine fishing altogether, citing the potential for continued fishing to speed the decline of the population and prevent any recovery. Scientists are also warning that the decline of the sardine population is having a broader impact on the ecosystem, with some ocean predators, such as sea lions, starving without sardines as a food source.\n\nOverall, the decline of the Pacific sardine population is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. The PFMC, conservation groups, and scientists must work together to understand the causes of the decline and develop effective management strategies to ensure the long-term health of the Pacific Ocean ecosystem.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is concise and easy to read:\n\nThe Pacific sardine population is in a severe decline, threatening the health of the West Coast's marine ecosystem.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1889}

The country has also committed to expanding the share of its energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20% by 2030, which would require the development of up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind, and solar.\n\nThe joint announcement is seen as a significant breakthrough in climate diplomacy, as the two countries have traditionally been seen as opposing camps in climate negotiations. The move is expected to inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, encouraging other countries to put forward their own ambitious emissions reduction targets.\n\nThe US and China's commitments are seen as a major step towards building a low-carbon global economy, and towards achieving the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

A record 20 million Americans collected unemployment benefits last year, and 36 states have increased the annual tax businesses pay to finance unemployment benefits. The average tax increase per worker ranges from a few dollars to nearly $1,000, with some states, such as Hawaii, facing an average increase of $1,070.\n\nThe crisis is particularly severe in states that have run out of funds and been forced to borrow from the federal government, raise taxes, or cut benefits. Thirty states have already borrowed more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. Nine more states are likely to borrow by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nBusiness owners, such as Don Miller of Creative Impressions in Virginia, are worried about the impact of higher unemployment taxes on their businesses. Miller's business has been down 15% in the past year, and he had to lay off two of his three workers. The recession has emptied Virginia's unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors.\n\nThe cuts to unemployment benefits are also affecting workers, such as James Hay, 70, who received a letter informing him that his monthly unemployment benefits are being cut to $100 from about $800.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is because west-facing panels capture more solar energy in the late afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which is when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are not only generating more electricity, but also reducing their reliance on the grid during peak hours.\n\nThe findings of the study have significant implications for the residential solar market. It suggests that homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar, may actually be better off with west-facing panels.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and gruel. His teeth were also heavily worn from chewing and using them as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that killed one of his front teeth, as well as a possible small stone in his gruel that may have caused a broken molar. The researchers suggest that the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time may be linked to the uptick in starches in the diet.\n\nIn addition to his dental issues, Ötzi's genome has been sequenced, revealing a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite his hunter-gatherer lifestyle. This suggests that we may be less able to prevent the condition than previously thought. The genome analysis also reveals more about Ötzi's ancestors, placing him in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, which is linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era.\n\nThe study also found that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and was lactose intolerant, like many Neolithic Europeans.
