{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish's blood from freezing, but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies.\n\nResearchers have found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This means that the fish can accumulate ice crystals in their bodies, which can persist for days or even weeks.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations to investigate the behavior of the antifreeze proteins.

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": "The Pacific coast of North America is home to a vibrant and diverse marine ecosystem, which is largely dependent on the presence of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently in a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and experts are urging the council to take action to protect the sardine population.\n\nThe PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of sardines is not only affecting the fishing industry, but also the marine mammals, seabirds, and predators that rely on them for food.\n\nThe reason for the decline is unclear, but scientists believe that a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may be playing a role. The decline has been so severe that the population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has also taken a dive. As a result, federal fishery managers have slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to fishing for sardines.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish that is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable. The species has a history of collapsing and rebounding, and scientists are still debating how much of the collapse is caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing.\n\nThe decline of sardines is having a devastating impact on the ocean food web, with some ocean predators starving without their primary food source. For example, a recent study found that 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up on beaches in 2013, likely due to a scarcity of sardines. The situation is urgent, and experts are calling for immediate action to protect the sardine population and the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nFor further information, please visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish or write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is concise and easy to read:\n\nThe Pacific sardine population is in a severe decline, threatening the West Coast's marine ecosystem.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The study also revealed that most former vegetarians and vegans (65%) transitioned to their veg diet in just a few days or weeks, while fewer current vegetarians (53%) transitioned that quickly, suggesting that a slower approach may lead to longer-lasting results.\n\nThe study found that relationships play a significant role in people's decisions to give up their vegetarian or vegan diet. A third of all former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarian or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. Additionally, the study found that current vegetarians were more likely to cite multiple reasons for being vegetarian, such as animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health, while many former vegetarians (58%) cited health as the main motivator.\n\nThe study also highlighted the challenges of maintaining a vegetarian or vegan diet, with over 60% of former vegetarians/vegans disliking sticking out from the crowd because of their diet, and 58% not seeing their diet as part of their identity. Nearly 50% said they found it too difficult to maintain a \"pure diet\".\n\nThe findings of the study suggest that a message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective in creating an overall decline in animal product consumption.

The study found that nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics are unnecessary, translating to approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year.\n\nThe study analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011 and found that most of these unnecessary prescriptions are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds. The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

A record 20 million Americans collected unemployment benefits last year, and 36 states have increased the annual tax businesses pay to finance unemployment benefits. The average tax increase per worker ranges from a few dollars to nearly $1,000, with some states, such as Hawaii, facing an average increase of $1,070.\n\nThe crisis is particularly severe in states that have run out of funds and been forced to borrow from the federal government, raise taxes, or cut benefits. Thirty states have already borrowed more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. Nine more states are likely to borrow by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nBusiness owners, such as Don Miller of Creative Impressions in Virginia, are worried about the impact of higher unemployment taxes on their businesses. Miller's business has been down 15% in the past year, and he had to lay off two of his three workers. The recession has emptied Virginia's unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors.\n\nWorkers, such as James Hay, 70, are also being hurt by the crisis. Hay's monthly unemployment benefits are being cut to $100 from about $800 because state law limits payments to Social Security recipients when the state's fund runs low. Hay was devastated by the news and is unsure how his family will get by.\n\nExperts warn that the measures taken by states to address the crisis may actually contribute to joblessness. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" says Gary Burtless, an economist who studies labor policy at the Brookings Institution. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\"\n\nThe crisis is not limited to states that have run out of funds. Many states are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have pushed politically difficult tax increases through their legislatures, making further benefit cuts likely if high unemployment persists.\n\nThe situation is expected to continue deteriorating unless states take action to address the crisis. \"The middle of a recession is when people need help most,\" says Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project. \"Cutting unemployment benefits undermines the fundamental goals of the program — boosting", "answers": ["Massive unemployment is putting a strain on state benefit funds, and states in turn are trying to recoup the money by raising taxes on employers.

{"pred": "A recent study by Pecan Street Research Institute has challenged the conventional wisdom that solar panels should face south to generate the most energy. The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is because west-facing panels capture more solar energy in the late afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the residential solar market. Homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar panels, may now be able to generate more electricity than those with south-facing panels. Additionally, the study suggests that utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they could help reduce peak demand and stress on the grid.\n\nThe study's lead author, Brewster McCracken, hopes that the findings will prompt utility companies to offer rebates for west-facing panels, which could incentivize more homeowners to install them. McCracken also notes that the study's results are not limited to the Austin area, and that west-facing panels may be effective in other regions as well.\n\nWhile some experts have questioned the study's findings, noting that the results may vary depending on the region and the structure of utility company incentives, the research has sparked an important conversation about the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice rather than relying solely on theoretical models.\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels may be a more effective and efficient way to generate electricity, particularly during peak demand hours.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense.

Researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands compared brain scans of 25 women before and after their first pregnancies, as well as 20 women who did not become pregnant during the study. The results showed that pregnancy led to changes in 11 areas of the brain, which were not seen in women who did not become pregnant.\n\nThe brain changes were most pronounced in areas involved in emotional processing, social cognition, and memory. The researchers found that the changes were still present two years after childbirth, suggesting that they are a long-term effect of pregnancy.\n\nThe study also found that the brain changes were linked to the strength of emotional attachment to the infant, and that the affected brain areas overlapped with circuitry involved in understanding another person's thoughts and feelings. This suggests that the brain changes may help women prepare for motherhood by improving their ability to understand and respond to their infant's needs.\n\nThe researchers believe that the brain changes are caused by the surge of sex hormones during pregnancy, which may lead to the pruning of brain cells and the formation of more specialized and efficient brain circuits.

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

She further unloaded to the Guardian: \"I’ve realized that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level. I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. ...

We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted.

Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas had a stronger phrase: \"mob rule,\" while Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois heard the \"noise of democracy.\" Democrats were staging a unified front to try to keep the hearing from proceeding, angry about withheld documents from Kavanaugh's past, including his tenure in the George W. Bush White House. The release of more than 40,000 documents Monday night seems to have only made things worse, with Democrats arguing that it was humanly impossible to review them in time. Despite the Democrats' protests, Senate Judiciary Committee Charles Grassley says he will not stop the hearing, which is expected to last four days, reports Politico.

Handmaid's Tale: Women dressed as characters from the Handmaid's Tale were among the protesters outside the hearing room, notes the Huffington Post. See an image here. The costumes illustrate their concerns that Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court will be a setback for women's rights. Roe v. Wade: When the direct questions finally begin, Democrats are expected to press Kavanaugh on whether he'd be willing to overturn the ruling that legalized abortion, reports the New York Times. The question, said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is not whether he believes that Roe v. Wade is “settled law,” but “whether you believe it is the correct law.” The judge's views on executive power and gun control also were expected to be examined. 2 views: The interruptions and chaos are about \"Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election and just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election,\" said Republican Ted Cruz, per the AP. But Democrat Patrick Leahy wondered, “What are we trying to hide? Why are we rushing?” Excerpts: Read excerpts of Kavanaugh's eventual opening statement here via MarketWatch. \"A good judge must be an umpire—a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,\" Kavanaugh is to say. \"I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.

The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

It sure sounded like a candidate's speech, writes Sean Sullivan in the Washington Post, who says Clinton must \"get in the game\" on key issues if she does indeed plan to run. On this issue in particular, Clinton can \"make her case as the heir apparent to Obama and try to persuade parts of his coalition—minorities and liberals in particular—to back her.\" (She spoke on the same day that North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed into place a law requiring voters to have a photo ID, reports the News & Observer.) Over at CBS, Anthony Weiner offers up a maybe-hint that Clinton will run when asked last night if he knows what wife Huma Abedin's role would be in a campaign. \"I do,\" he said. But, \"I'm not telling you.\" In the coming months, Clinton plans speeches on national security and America's standing in the world.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of New South Wales and Miami University, analyzed data from an online first-person shooter video game, Halo 3, to examine how individual performance and social standing affect female-directed male behavior.\n\nThe study found that low-status males who perform poorly in the game are more likely to be hostile towards female players, while high-status males who perform well are more likely to be positive and supportive. The researchers suggest that this behavior is driven by an evolutionary perspective, where low-status males feel threatened by the presence of a female competitor and attempt to suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank.\n\nThe study also found that the frequency of negative comments towards female players decreases as the focal player's performance improves, and that higher-skilled males are more likely to be positive and supportive towards female players.

Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Around the one-minute mark, Flores raises his arms and the officers appear to fire at least two shots from about 10 yards away. Flores appears to slouch forward before falling to the ground. An officer approaches Flores' seemingly lifeless body 30 seconds later, grabs his arm, and drags him along the ground. An ambulance arrives just before the video ends. Police say they first tried to subdue Flores, 41, with a Taser and shield before shooting him, per the San Antonio Express-News. It isn't clear how many shots were fired or how many times Flores was hit. Police say the 20-minute encounter began when officers visited a home in the area to find a bleeding woman with a cut on her head, holding a baby who may have been injured, per KSAT. They say Flores, who had a criminal record, was there holding a knife. \"Certainly, what's in the video is a cause for concern,\" a sheriff tells the New York Daily News. \"But it's important to let the investigation go through its course.\" A district attorney agrees the video is \"troubling,\" telling KSAT, \"There's actually another video with a better view that is very close.\" He adds, \"There's a lot of information before, including 911 calls and information from different witnesses inside the house.\" On Facebook, Bexar County police slam KSAT for posting the video, calling the move \"unethical and sad\" and \"sensational behavior,\" noting it has resulted in \"physical threats toward our deputies.\" Vasquez and Sanchez are both on administrative leave."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8009}

Some have hailed him as a hero for revealing the extent of the government's surveillance programs, while others have condemned him as a traitor for leaking classified information.\n\nThe US government has defended the surveillance programs, saying they are necessary to prevent terrorist attacks and have helped to disrupt plots and prevent attacks. However, critics have argued that the programs are overly broad and violate the privacy rights of Americans.\n\nSnowden's choice of Hong Kong as a haven has raised questions about the territory's extradition treaty with the US. Under the treaty, Hong Kong is required to extradite fugitives from the US, but the Chinese government has the right to veto the extradition if it believes it would harm the country's \"defence, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy\".\n\nThe Chinese government has not commented on Snowden's case, but some analysts believe that Beijing may be reluctant to extradite him due to the potential political fallout. The US and China have a complex relationship, and the US has been critical of China's human rights record.\n\nIn the meantime, Snowden has been living in Hong Kong, where he has been granted temporary asylum. He has been in contact with journalists and has spoken publicly about his actions, saying that he believes the US government's surveillance programs are a threat to democracy and individual freedom.\n\nThe case has sparked a global debate about the balance between national security and individual privacy, and has raised questions about the role of whistleblowers in holding governments accountable.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is one page long:\n\nEdward Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor, has revealed himself as the source of classified documents detailing the US government's surveillance programs.

(And then there's the stir-crazy factor; he has apparently left his room just three times in the last three weeks.) Snowden—who admits he doesn't expect to see home again—says he chose Hong Kong because they \"have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent,\" though his first choice for asylum would be Iceland, CNN reports. Some Hong Kong politicians say the territory's history of working closely with the US makes it a poor choice for Snowden—though others say they are \"flattered.\" A criminal investigation into the leak has begun and the US is expected to begin extradition proceedings soon; a long legal battle in Hong Kong could ensue before Beijing decides on using its veto, the Wall Street Journal reports. In the meantime, Snowden has gotten his very own White House petition, with some 8,734 people, at the time of this writing, requesting \"a full, free, and absolute pardon\" for the \"national hero.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 8571}

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Using a brain-reading device, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by detecting patterns in their brain activity. The device, known as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Plos Biology, involved four patients who were trained to use the system to answer questions about their quality of life. The patients, who were all cared for at home by family members, were asked to think \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France.\" The computer hooked up to the cap learned to distinguish the blood flow patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient.\n\nWhen the patients scored at least 70% on the training questions, the doctors moved on to more personal questions. The most important of these were about quality of life, and surprisingly, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with life. This suggests that locked-in syndrome may not be the living hell many presume it to be.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the treatment of patients with ALS and other conditions that leave people unable to communicate. The researchers hope to build a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. They also believe that the technology could be used to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state.\n\nThe study's lead author, Niels Birbaumer, said that the results were \"one of the most satisfying moments of my life\" and that the technology could \"abolish completely locked-in syndrome forever.\" The researchers are now working to replicate the findings in a larger group of patients and to develop a portable and cost-effective system for communicating with patients who are entirely physically non-responsive.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is one page long:\n\nResearchers have made a groundbreaking breakthrough in communicating with patients who are completely paralyzed and unable to speak, known as \"locked-in\" syndrome.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer.

At least 73 youngsters have been executed in Iran between 2005 and 2015, per the report, and at least 160 juveniles are now on the country's death row, and those are probably conservative numbers (the report notes actual figures are probably higher but unknown because info about the death penalty is \"shrouded in secrecy\").

This in spite of supposedly significant changes to the country's Islamic Penal Code—changes meant to offer judges \"alternative punishments\" to the death penalty when juveniles are involved. In fact, the need for those changes in the first place shows what a dismal failure Iran has been in dealing with this issue, since in 1994 it ratified its participation in the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that \"neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed [on] … persons below 18 years of age.\" \"The report debunks recent attempts by Iran's authorities to whitewash their continuing violations of children's rights and deflect criticism of their appalling record as one of the world's last executioners of juvenile offenders,\" the Amnesty report reads.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post.

The answer was not as sophisticated as one might expect, and it was born out of necessity.\n\nIn the early days of the program, there was no thought given to the astronauts' need to urinate during flight. The first astronaut, Alan Shepard, had to hold it for hours before his flight, and when he finally had to go, he was denied permission to leave the capsule. He was forced to wet his suit, a potentially risky move.\n\nThe second manned spaceflight, flown by Gus Grissom, also lacked a urine collection device. However, a makeshift system was developed, which included a garter belt with a condom connected to a collection bag.\n\nAs the program progressed, a urine collection system was developed, which included a tube emptying into a bag with a one-way valve. This system was used for the rest of the Mercury flights.\n\nThe Gemini program, which aimed to achieve long-duration spaceflight, posed a new challenge. Astronauts had to develop a poop containment system, which included a foot-long tube-shaped bag with an adhesive lining. The bags were stored in the spacecraft and the samples analyzed by doctors after splashdown.\n\nThe Apollo spacecraft, which took astronauts to the moon, had a very minimal amount of washroom privacy. Astronauts had to strip down completely naked to use the washroom, and for the crews who landed on the moon, using the washroom was both easier and harder.\n\nIn the end, NASA diapered its astronauts, but accidents still happened. Charlie Duke, an astronaut on Apollo 16, had to urinate just before lifting off from the moon and found out that his urine containment system had become unattached from his person.\n\nToday, longer term missions on the International Space Station have yielded advances in washroom technology, and moderate privacy is now a necessity.

Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous.

The CIA is scrambling to deal with the fallout from WikiLeaks' release Tuesday of a vast trove of data on the agency's hacking tools. A former senior intelligence official tells the Washington Post that the leak, which experts believe is genuine, could \"cause grave if not irreparable damage to the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct our mission.\" A roundup of coverage: One hack, code-named Weeping Angel, allows spies to capture audio and possibly video from Samsung smart TVs that appear to be turned off. Wired has a guide to telling whether your TV has been hacked. PC World reports that the WikiLeaks release included snippets of code that antivirus vendors can now use to determine whether hacking attempts originated at the CIA. MIT Technology Review describes the leaked information, including news that the CIA has found vulnerabilities in iOS and Android, as \"sinister\" but not \"particularly Earth-shattering\" from a technological point of view. Business Insider examines some of WikiLeaks' claims and finds that there's no evidence that the CIA was able to crack the encryption of apps like Signal and WhatsApp. Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, tells the New York Times he's disturbed by signs that the government knew about vulnerabilities in electronic devices and kept them quiet to make spying easier. \"Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world,\" Wizner says. \"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\" Forbes spoke to security experts from several companies about the leak. They said the information about the CIA's technological capabilities is unsurprising, but that it should serve as a reminder to people that they cannot fully trust the security of their devices. \"People need to wake up to the fact that they need to take responsibility for maintaining the privacy of their information and make no assumptions,\" says Ajay Arora, CEO of Vera. \"At the end of the day, no one has your best interests in mind but you—people can't even trust their own government anymore. This is the tragic new normal we have to all unfortunately accept.\" Companies including Google, Samsung, and WhatsApp declined to comment, the Washington Post reports. Apple released a statement saying the issues disclosed in the leak were patched in a recent update and that they \"always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security update.\" \"Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV.

According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, the average CEO of a large company earned 312 times more than the average worker in 2017. This gap has been growing steadily over the past few decades, with CEOs' pay increasing by 979% between 1978 and 2017, while workers' pay has only risen by 11.2%.\n\nThe report also found that the pay of CEOs is not driven by their individual performance, but rather by the overall performance of the stock market. When the stock market rises, CEOs' pay tends to increase, regardless of their company's actual performance. This is because many CEOs are paid in stock options, which are tied to the company's stock price.\n\nThe report suggests that the growing pay gap between CEOs and workers is a result of economic rents, or concessions that CEOs can draw from the economy not by virtue of their contribution to economic output, but by virtue of their position. This means that CEOs are able to command high salaries and benefits because of their power and influence, rather than because of their actual performance.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap is not limited to CEOs, but is a broader phenomenon that affects many high-income earners. The top 1% of earners in the United States, who include many CEOs and other high-income professionals, have seen their incomes rise significantly over the past few decades, while the incomes of the bottom 90% of earners have stagnated.\n\nThe report concludes that the growing pay gap between CEOs and workers is a major economic and social issue that needs to be addressed. It suggests that policies such as higher marginal income tax rates for the top 1% and greater transparency in executive compensation could help to reduce the gap and promote more equitable economic growth.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary in a more concise and readable format:\n\n**CEO Pay Gap Widens**\n\nA new report by the Economic Policy Institute reveals that the average CEO of a large company earned 312 times more than the average worker in 2017.

The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older.
