The report, which took four years to complete and cost $40 million, is said to be a scathing indictment of the program, which involved the use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists.\n\nThe committee, led by Senator Mark Udall, has urged President Barack Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report, citing the importance of transparency and accountability. However, the CIA has disputed some of the report's findings and has refused to release the document, citing executive privilege.\n\nThe dispute has escalated to the point where the CIA Inspector General's Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the agency, including the monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the report.

The report remains classified nearly 15 months after the panel approved the document and turned it over to the agency for vetting.\n\nThe conflict over the report has heightened tensions between the CIA and the Senate committee, with some lawmakers calling for greater transparency and accountability.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish's blood from freezing, but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals around with them for most of their lives, which could be detrimental to their health.\n\nResearchers have found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has been observed in controlled settings, but this is the first time it has been found in nature.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the fish may have evolved a mechanism to clear the ice crystals from their circulation, but the long-term cost of having these proteins is still unknown. The researchers are unsure whether the fish can tolerate the presence of ice crystals in their bodies or if it has any adverse effects on their health.\n\nThe discovery provides new insights into the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the trade-offs that come with them. It also highlights the complexity of the fish's adaptation to their freezing environment and the need for further research to understand the long-term consequences of this adaptation.\n\nIn summary, the study reveals that the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish have a paradoxical effect, preventing the fish's blood from freezing while also inhibiting the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies.

These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, not only prevent their blood from freezing but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals with them for most of their lives, which could be detrimental to their health.\n\nThe study found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has significant implications for our understanding of the", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}
