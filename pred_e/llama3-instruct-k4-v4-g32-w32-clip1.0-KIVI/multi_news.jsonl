The report, which took four years to complete and cost $40 million, is said to be a scathing indictment of the program, which involved the use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists.\n\nThe committee, led by Senator Mark Udall, has urged President Barack Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report, citing the importance of transparency and accountability. However, the CIA has disputed some of the report's findings and has refused to release the document, citing executive privilege.\n\nThe dispute has escalated to the point where the CIA Inspector General's Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the agency, including the monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the report.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish's blood from freezing, but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals around with them for most of their lives, which could be detrimental to their health.\n\nResearchers have found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has been observed in controlled settings, but this is the first time it has been found in nature.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the fish may have evolved a mechanism to clear the ice crystals from their circulation, but the long-term cost of having these proteins is still unknown. The researchers are unsure whether the fish can tolerate the presence of ice crystals in their bodies or if it has any adverse effects on their health.\n\nThe discovery provides new insights into the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the trade-offs that come with them. It also highlights the complexity of the fish's adaptation to their freezing environment and the need for further research to understand the long-term consequences of this adaptation.\n\nIn summary, the study reveals that the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish have a paradoxical effect, preventing the fish's blood from freezing while also inhibiting the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies.

These proteins, which help the fish survive in freezing waters, not only prevent their blood from freezing but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside their bodies. This means that the fish may be carrying ice crystals with them for most of their lives, which could be detrimental to their health.\n\nThe study found that the antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, but also make it difficult for them to melt, even in temperatures above freezing. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has significant implications for our understanding of the", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

{"pred": "The Pacific coast of North America is home to a vibrant and diverse marine ecosystem, which is largely dependent on the presence of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently in a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The decline is causing concern among scientists and conservation groups, as it is affecting not only the sardine fishery but also the populations of other marine species that rely on sardines as a food source.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and is being urged to take action to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean. Specifically, the PFMC is being asked to set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and to fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe decline of the sardine population is attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. This has repelled sardines, leading to a 72% decline in the population since its last peak in 2006. The decline has also led to a decrease in spawning, and federal fishery managers have slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds.\n\nConservation groups are urging the PFMC to halt sardine fishing altogether, citing the potential for continued fishing to speed the decline of the population and prevent any recovery. Scientists are also warning that the decline of the sardine population is having a broader impact on the ecosystem, with some ocean predators, such as sea lions, starving without sardines as a food source.\n\nOverall, the decline of the Pacific sardine population is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. The PFMC, conservation groups, and scientists must work together to understand the causes of the decline and develop effective management strategies to ensure the long-term health of the Pacific Ocean ecosystem.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is concise and easy to read:\n\nThe Pacific sardine population is in a severe decline, threatening the health of the West Coast's marine ecosystem.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1889}

The country has also committed to expanding the share of its energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20% by 2030, which would require the development of up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind, and solar.\n\nThe joint announcement is seen as a significant breakthrough in climate diplomacy, as the two countries have traditionally been seen as opposing camps in climate negotiations. The move is expected to inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, encouraging other countries to put forward their own ambitious emissions reduction targets.\n\nThe US and China's commitments are seen as a major step towards building a low-carbon global economy, and towards achieving the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

A record 20 million Americans collected unemployment benefits last year, and 36 states have increased the annual tax businesses pay to finance unemployment benefits. The average tax increase per worker ranges from a few dollars to nearly $1,000, with some states, such as Hawaii, facing an average increase of $1,070.\n\nThe crisis is particularly severe in states that have run out of funds and been forced to borrow from the federal government, raise taxes, or cut benefits. Thirty states have already borrowed more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. Nine more states are likely to borrow by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nBusiness owners, such as Don Miller of Creative Impressions in Virginia, are worried about the impact of higher unemployment taxes on their businesses. Miller's business has been down 15% in the past year, and he had to lay off two of his three workers. The recession has emptied Virginia's unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors.\n\nThe cuts to unemployment benefits are also affecting workers, such as James Hay, 70, who received a letter informing him that his monthly unemployment benefits are being cut to $100 from about $800.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is because west-facing panels capture more solar energy in the late afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which is when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are not only generating more electricity, but also reducing their reliance on the grid during peak hours.\n\nThe findings of the study have significant implications for the residential solar market. It suggests that homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who were previously thought to be poor candidates for solar, may actually be better off with west-facing panels.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and gruel. His teeth were also heavily worn from chewing and using them as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that killed one of his front teeth, as well as a possible small stone in his gruel that may have caused a broken molar. The researchers suggest that the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time may be linked to the uptick in starches in the diet.\n\nIn addition to his dental issues, Ötzi's genome has been sequenced, revealing a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite his hunter-gatherer lifestyle. This suggests that we may be less able to prevent the condition than previously thought. The genome analysis also reveals more about Ötzi's ancestors, placing him in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, which is linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era.\n\nThe study also found that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and was lactose intolerant, like many Neolithic Europeans.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4511}

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing.

The police chief, Fred Waller, blamed gang members for the violence, saying they do not fear repercussions from the law and use innocent bystanders as cover to take revenge.\n\nThe violence was felt across the city, with hospitals and emergency services stretched to the limit. Stroger Hospital, in particular, was overwhelmed, with access limited to immediate family members of victims. The hospital's trauma unit received an unusually high volume of patients, with many suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nThe victims included a 17-year-old girl, Jahnae Patterson, who was shot in the face and pronounced dead at the scene.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The proposal, which includes austerity measures and debt relief, has been rejected by the Greek government, which is led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Tsipras has called on voters to reject the proposal, saying that it is unfair and will only lead to more austerity and hardship for the Greek people.\n\nThe referendum has sparked widespread protests and demonstrations across Greece, with both sides of the debate passionately arguing their case. The \"yes\" campaign, which is supported by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, argues that the proposal is necessary to prevent Greece from defaulting on its debts and to keep the country in the eurozone. The \"no\" campaign, which is supported by the Greek government, argues that the proposal is unfair and will only lead to more austerity and hardship for the Greek people.\n\nThe Greek economy is already in a state of crisis, with high unemployment and poverty rates, and the country has been reliant on international bailouts to stay afloat. The current bailout program is set to expire on Tuesday, and if Greece does not accept the proposal, it will be cut off from international credit markets and will have to rely on its own resources to fund its economy.\n\nThe outcome of the referendum is uncertain, and both sides are warning of the consequences of a \"no\" vote. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund have warned that a \"no\" vote will lead to Greece's expulsion from the eurozone and a return to the drachma, which could lead to economic chaos and instability. The Greek government, on the other hand, is warning that a \"yes\" vote will lead to more austerity and hardship for the Greek people.\n\nThe referendum has also sparked a debate about the future of the eurozone and the role of the European Union in the crisis. Some have argued that the crisis is a result of the EU's strict austerity policies, while others have argued that the crisis is a result of Greece's own economic mismanagement.\n\nIn the meantime, Greece's banks and markets remain closed, and the country is facing a severe economic crisis.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\").

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of New South Wales and Miami University, analyzed data from an online first-person shooter video game, Halo 3, to examine how individual performance and social standing affect female-directed male behavior.\n\nThe study found that low-status males who perform poorly in the game are more likely to be hostile towards female players, while high-status males who perform well are more likely to be positive and supportive. The researchers suggest that this behavior is driven by an evolutionary perspective, where low-status males feel threatened by the presence of a female competitor and attempt to suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank.\n\nThe study also found that the frequency of negative comments towards female players decreases as the focal player's performance improves, and that higher-skilled males are more likely to be positive and supportive towards female players.

However, the North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) and the Fraternal Information and Programming Group (FIPG) opposed the ban, arguing that it would not solve the problem of excessive drinking and hazing.\n\nThe article highlights the risks associated with fraternity membership, including the high incidence of alcohol-related injuries and deaths. It also notes that many fraternities have policies in place to manage risk, but these policies are often inadequate and may even exacerbate the problem.\n\nThe article features interviews with two experts on the topic: Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who has represented families of fraternity members who have been injured or killed, and Peter Smithhisler, the CEO of the NIC. Fierberg argues that fraternities are inherently risky and that their risk-management policies are flawed. Smithhisler, on the other hand, believes that fraternities can be a positive force in college life, providing opportunities for leadership, service, and personal growth.\n\nThe article also discusses the crisis-management plans that many fraternities have in place, which are designed to handle situations where a member is injured or killed. These plans often involve a series of steps, including contacting the fraternity's national headquarters, closing the fraternity house, and providing support to the affected members.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that while fraternities can be a positive force in college life, they also pose significant risks to members and must be carefully managed to ensure the safety and well-being of all involved.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary in a concise and clear format:\n\n**Fraternity Controversy**\n\nA California Polytechnic State University freshman died from a hazing ritual, leading to a ban on fraternity recruitment.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training. But parents should know the dangers: \"Until proven otherwise,\" a lawyer tells Flanagan, \"they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in.\" Click for her full piece."], "all_classes": null, "length": 13444}

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asking him about his 2002 email in which he wrote that security procedures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks should ultimately be race-neutral. Kavanaugh conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled and that racism still exists in the United States.\n\nThe hearing also saw a focus on Kavanaugh's views on abortion, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asking him about a 2003 email in which he questioned whether the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion should be described as \"settled law of the land.\" Kavanaugh explained that he was simply summarizing views of legal scholars and not offering his own view.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided commenting on President Trump's behavior, despite urging from Senate Democrats. He also declined to answer a series of questions from Harris about issues that might come before the high court, including same-sex marriage and immigration.\n\nThe hearing is expected to conclude on Friday, with Kavanaugh likely to win confirmation in time to take his place alongside the eight justices on the Supreme Court when the court begins its fall term next month.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary in a more concise and organized format:\n\n**Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh's Confirmation Hearing Continues**\n\n", "answers": ["Day three of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing has opened with a bang: Democratic Sen.

Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W.

Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time.

{"pred": "Here is a one-page summary of the news:\n\n**Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Comments on Donald Trump**\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her recent comments on Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. In a series of interviews, Ginsburg criticized Trump's character, saying he is a \"faker\" with \"no consistency\" and that he would be a \"disaster\" for the country. Ginsburg's comments have been widely reported and have sparked a heated debate about the role of judges in politics.\n\n**Code of Conduct for Judges**\n\nThe controversy surrounding Ginsburg's comments highlights the importance of the Code of Conduct for Judges, which prohibits judges from engaging in political activity and from making public statements that could be perceived as endorsing or opposing a particular candidate. The Code also requires judges to recuse themselves from cases involving parties with whom they have a financial interest or other conflict of interest.\n\n**Ginsburg's Biography and Career**\n\nGinsburg, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, is a lifelong left-of-center lawyer and feminist innovator.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

{"pred": "Researchers have made a groundbreaking breakthrough in communicating with patients who are completely paralyzed and unable to speak, known as \"locked-in\" syndrome. Using a brain-reading device, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by detecting patterns in their brain activity. The device, known as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Plos Biology, involved four patients who were trained to use the system to answer questions about their quality of life. The patients, who were all cared for at home by family members, were asked to think \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France.\" The computer hooked up to the cap learned to distinguish the blood flow patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient.\n\nWhen the patients scored at least 70% on the training questions, the doctors moved on to more personal questions. The most important of these were about quality of life, and surprisingly, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with life. This suggests that locked-in syndrome may not be the living hell many presume it to be.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the treatment of patients with ALS and other conditions that leave people paralyzed but still aware. The researchers hope to build a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. The study's lead author, Niels Birbaumer, believes that a system that reads brain activity could achieve the same ends as the French journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby, who dictated his bestselling memoir by blinking his left eye.\n\nThe study's results have also sparked interest in the potential for fNIRS to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000.

The extension, called \"Marauder's Map,\" shows the exact locations of users who have sent messages with their location enabled.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nWhen a user sends a message from the Messenger app, their location is automatically shared with the recipient. This location data is not only shared with friends, but also with strangers who are part of the same chat group. The data is precise, with coordinates accurate to within a meter.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nKhanna's extension revealed that users' locations can be tracked over time, allowing others to infer their daily schedules and even pinpoint their exact locations.

A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system.

The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.
