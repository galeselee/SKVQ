The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say.

Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently experiencing a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The decline is causing concern among scientists and conservation groups, as it is affecting not only the sardine population itself but also the predators that rely on it for food.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The council has also been criticized for not doing enough to address the decline, with some groups calling for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe decline of the sardine population is attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. This has repelled sardines and led to a decline in their numbers. Additionally, overfishing and a lack of understanding of the causes of the decline are also contributing to the problem.\n\nThe effects of the sardine decline are being felt throughout the ecosystem, with predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and seabirds struggling to find food. The decline is also having an economic impact on the fishing industry, with fishermen reporting low catches and financial losses.\n\nConservation groups are calling for action to protect the sardine population and the ecosystem as a whole. They argue that the decline of the sardine population is a warning sign of a larger problem and that urgent action is needed to address the issue.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

This move is seen as a major step forward in the global fight against climate change, as it encourages other countries to set their own ambitious emissions reduction targets and paves the way for a strong global climate agreement in 2015.\n\nThe US has committed to reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, with a goal of transforming its economy and achieving 80% emissions reductions by 2050. This target builds on the country's existing goal of reducing emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, which is on track to be met.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. The country has also committed to expanding the share of its energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20% by 2030, which will require the development of up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind, and solar.\n\nThe joint announcement by the US and China is seen as a significant milestone in the US-China relationship and a major step forward in global climate diplomacy.

The average tax per worker has increased by 78% in Virginia, with some states facing increases of over $1,000 per worker.\n\nThe crisis is attributed to a record 20 million Americans collecting unemployment benefits last year, with 25 states borrowing over $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. Nine more states are expected to borrow by mid-year. The situation is deteriorating fast, with many states' trust funds dwindling rapidly.\n\nTo make up for the shortfall, states are implementing measures such as raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors. For example, Virginia has increased the average tax on employers to $171 per worker, while Hawaii's employers face an average increase of $1,070 per worker. Some states are also cutting benefits for the unemployed, with Pennsylvania workers receiving 2.3% less in benefits starting this month.\n\nEconomists warn that these measures may contribute to joblessness, rather than stimulating the economy. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\"\n\nThe crisis has also led to benefit cuts for seniors, with some states cutting benefits by as much as a third.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy during the late afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which is when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time when their own usage surges and when the utility company needs the most help.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during peak demand by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This reduction in peak demand could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes.\n\nThe study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, as it opens up the solar market to every homeowner who doesn't have significant shading issues. It also means that homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, even if they do have a south-facing roof, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours.\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, it's important to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's hard to predict what the outcome would be if the same study were conducted during the winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked debate among solar panel installers and utility companies. Some solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while, but utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb and refuse to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and gruel. His teeth were also heavily worn from chewing and using them as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that killed one of his front teeth, as well as a broken molar that may have been caused by a small stone in his food. The researchers suggest that the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time period may be linked to the uptick in starches in the diet.\n\nIn addition to his dental issues, Ötzi's genome was also sequenced, revealing a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite his hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare.

I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized. \"I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,\" he said, per Gothamist. (Variety notes that Hand to God, which has been struggling to sell tickets, was happy to capitalize by organizing that press conference.)
