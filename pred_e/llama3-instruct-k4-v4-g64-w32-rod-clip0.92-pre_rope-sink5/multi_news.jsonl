The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say.

Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently experiencing a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The decline is causing concern among scientists and conservation groups, as it is affecting not only the sardine population itself but also the predators that rely on it for food.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The council has also been criticized for not doing enough to address the decline, with some groups calling for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe decline of the sardine population is attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. This has repelled sardines and led to a decline in their numbers. Additionally, overfishing and a lack of understanding of the causes of the decline are also contributing to the problem.\n\nThe effects of the sardine decline are being felt throughout the ecosystem, with predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and seabirds struggling to find food. The decline is also having an economic impact on the fishing industry, with fishermen reporting low catches and financial losses.\n\nConservation groups are calling for action to protect the sardine population and the ecosystem as a whole. They argue that the decline of the sardine population is a warning sign of a larger problem and that urgent action is needed to address the issue.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

This move is seen as a major step forward in the global fight against climate change, as it encourages other countries to set their own ambitious emissions reduction targets and paves the way for a strong global climate agreement in 2015.\n\nThe US has committed to reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, with a goal of transforming its economy and achieving 80% emissions reductions by 2050. This target builds on the country's existing goal of reducing emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, which is on track to be met.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. The country has also committed to expanding the share of its energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20% by 2030, which will require the development of up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind, and solar.\n\nThe joint announcement by the US and China is seen as a significant milestone in the US-China relationship and a major step forward in global climate diplomacy.

The average tax per worker has increased by 78% in Virginia, with some states facing increases of over $1,000 per worker.\n\nThe crisis is attributed to a record 20 million Americans collecting unemployment benefits last year, with 25 states borrowing over $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. Nine more states are expected to borrow by mid-year. The situation is deteriorating fast, with many states' trust funds dwindling rapidly.\n\nTo make up for the shortfall, states are implementing measures such as raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors. For example, Virginia has increased the average tax on employers to $171 per worker, while Hawaii's employers face an average increase of $1,070 per worker. Some states are also cutting benefits for the unemployed, with Pennsylvania workers receiving 2.3% less in benefits starting this month.\n\nEconomists warn that these measures may contribute to joblessness, rather than stimulating the economy. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\"\n\nThe crisis has also led to benefit cuts for seniors, with some states cutting benefits by as much as a third.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy during the late afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which is when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time when their own usage surges and when the utility company needs the most help.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during peak demand by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This reduction in peak demand could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes.\n\nThe study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, as it opens up the solar market to every homeowner who doesn't have significant shading issues. It also means that homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, even if they do have a south-facing roof, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours.\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, it's important to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's hard to predict what the outcome would be if the same study were conducted during the winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked debate among solar panel installers and utility companies. Some solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while, but utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb and refuse to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and gruel. His teeth were also heavily worn from chewing and using them as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that killed one of his front teeth, as well as a broken molar that may have been caused by a small stone in his food. The researchers suggest that the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time period may be linked to the uptick in starches in the diet.\n\nIn addition to his dental issues, Ötzi's genome was also sequenced, revealing a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite his hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

However, subsequent visits failed to find more of the species, and it was assumed to be extinct.\n\nResearchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Mexico's Ecology Institute, led by Daniel Mulcahy and Juan Martinez Gomez, embarked on an expedition to the island last May to search for the snake.

According to a new study, the ice sheet has lost nearly 84 billion tons of ice per year from 1992 to 2011, but this rate has increased to over 241 billion tons per year from 2012 to 2017. This melting has contributed to a rise in global sea levels of about 3mm since 1992.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, used 24 different methods to assess ice loss in Antarctica, including satellite data, ground measurements, and computer simulations. The researchers found that the melting is occurring mainly in West Antarctica, where most of the ice is floating on the ocean. The study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, warned that if the current trend continues, Antarctica could contribute up to 50cm to sea level rise by the end of the century.\n\nThe melting is attributed to warmer ocean waters, which are causing the ice sheets to melt from below. The warming of the southern ocean is linked to global warming, which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The study's findings are consistent with other research that has shown that Antarctica's ice sheet is losing mass at an accelerating rate.\n\nThe study's authors emphasized that the situation is dire and that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the rate of global warming. The melting of Antarctica's ice sheet is a major concern because it could have significant impacts on global sea levels and coastal communities.\n\nIn related news, another study published in Nature found that the East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2-5 million years ago when carbon dioxide levels were similar to those today. This suggests that the current melting of Antarctica's ice sheet is likely driven by human activities and not natural variability.\n\nOverall, the studies highlight the urgent need for action to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of global warming on Antarctica's ice sheet and the world's oceans.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is one page long:\n\nThe melting of Antarctica's ice sheet is accelerating at an alarming rate, with about 3 trillion tons of ice disappearing since 1992.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4511}

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The initial greeting was a friendly one, with Trump grasping the arm of his fellow world leader during the handshake.

Kim, for his part, said \"it has not been easy to get here,\" adding that \"the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles, but we have overcome them and we are here today,\" per the Guardian. After the ceremonial introduction, the two men met with only their interpreters in tow, then walked together along a balcony as they headed to a larger meeting with aides. Trump told reporters from the balcony that the meeting was \"very, very good\" and predicted he and Kim \"will solve a big problem, a big dilemma,\" reports the AP. It was difficult to hear the two men, but the AP adds that Kim appeared to agree with the optimism.

The vote has been marked by intense campaigning, with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras urging voters to reject the creditors' proposals and his opponents calling for a \"yes\" vote.\n\nThe country's top court has rejected a petition to declare the referendum illegal, and party leaders, personalities, and church elders have weighed in with impassioned pleas to vote \"no\" or \"yes\" on the airwaves and social media. A series of polls published on Friday showed the two sides in a dead heat, with an incremental lead of the \"yes\" vote well within the margin of error.\n\nThe question on the ballot paper is complex, asking voters to approve or reject the creditors' proposal, which includes two parts: reforms for the completion of the current program and beyond, and a preliminary debt sustainability analysis. The vote has been marked by uncertainty, with many Greeks unsure of what the consequences of a \"no\" vote would be.\n\nThe country's banks and markets have been closed for five days, and the government has imposed capital controls to prevent a run on banks.

Plural marriage was seen as a commandment from God and was believed to be a way to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant. It was also seen as a way to unite families and create a sense of cohesion among church members.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without controversy, however.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of New South Wales and Miami University, analyzed data from an online first-person shooter video game, Halo 3, to examine how individual performance and social standing affect female-directed hostility.\n\nThe study found that low-status males who perform poorly in the game are more likely to be hostile towards female players, while high-status males who perform well are more likely to be supportive. The researchers suggest that this behavior is driven by an evolutionary perspective, where low-status males feel threatened by the presence of a female competitor and attempt to suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank.\n\nThe study also found that the frequency of negative comments towards female players decreases as the player's skill level increases, suggesting that higher-skilled males are less likely to engage in sexist behavior.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

In a series of interviews, Ginsburg criticized Trump's character, calling him a \"faker\" and saying that she cannot imagine what the country would be like with him as president. Trump responded by calling for Ginsburg to resign from the court, saying that her comments were \"inappropriate\" and \"beneath the court.\"\n\n**Code of Conduct for Judges**\n\nThe controversy surrounding Ginsburg's comments highlights the importance of the Code of Conduct for Judges, which outlines the ethical standards that judges must follow. The Code prohibits judges from engaging in political activity, including making speeches or endorsements for political candidates. It also requires judges to avoid even the appearance of impropriety and to maintain the integrity and independence of the judiciary.\n\n**Ginsburg's Biography and Career**\n\nGinsburg, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, is a lifelong liberal and feminist.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Using a brain-reading device, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by detecting patterns in their brain activity. The device, which uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain, was able to learn to distinguish the blood flow patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Plos Biology, involved four patients who were trained to use the system more than a year after they were diagnosed with completely locked-in syndrome. The patients, who were all cared for at home by family members, were asked to think \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to a series of simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France.\"\n\nThe results showed that all four patients were able to answer the questions correctly, with an accuracy rate of over 70%. The patients were then asked more personal questions, including about their quality of life. Surprisingly, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with their lives, suggesting that locked-in syndrome may not be the living hell that many people assume it to be.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Niels Birbaumer, believes that the findings could have a significant impact on the lives of patients with locked-in syndrome. \"This is the first time we've been able to establish reliable communication with these patients, and I think that is important for them and their families,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers are now working on building a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. They are also exploring the use of the technology to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state.\n\nThe study's findings have also raised questions about the quality of life of patients with locked-in syndrome. While many people assume that such patients would be miserable and unhappy, the study suggests that this may not be the case. \"We find that they see life in a more positive way,\" said Birbaumer. \"We don't know why, but it's possible that they become focused on the good social interactions around them, and even experience something akin to a state of meditation because they cannot feel or move their bodies.\"assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is concise and easy", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

At least 73 youngsters have been executed in Iran between 2005 and 2015, per the report, and at least 160 juveniles are now on the country's death row, and those are probably conservative numbers (the report notes actual figures are probably higher but unknown because info about the death penalty is \"shrouded in secrecy\"). And it's apparently much worse for girls than for boys, a deputy director for the group says. \"Iran continues to lag behind the rest of the world, maintaining laws that permit girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to be sentenced to death,\" says Said Boumedouha. This in spite of supposedly significant changes to the country's Islamic Penal Code—changes meant to offer judges \"alternative punishments\" to the death penalty when juveniles are involved. In fact, the need for those changes in the first place shows what a dismal failure Iran has been in dealing with this issue, since in 1994 it ratified its participation in the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that \"neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed [on] … persons below 18 years of age.\" \"The report debunks recent attempts by Iran's authorities to whitewash their continuing violations of children's rights and deflect criticism of their appalling record as one of the world's last executioners of juvenile offenders,\" the Amnesty report reads.
