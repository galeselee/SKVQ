The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

Analysis of the tool—which is made from orange agate not usually found in the area—revealed it had been used to butcher an animal believed to be the extinct buffalo species Bison antiquus, KTVZ reports. University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady says the team plans to keep excavating the site after the \"tantalizing\" find, which may be older than any other find predating the Clovis people once thought to be the first in North America, NBC News reports. University of Washington professor of archaeology Donald K. Grayson, however, predicts there will be a lot of skepticism about the find. \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he tells the AP. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" (Experts believe they have found evidence of a long-lost civilization in the Honduran rainforest.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1460}

According to a Health Ministry paper, the cost of cigarettes could rise by around a third every year to reach the target price within eight years. However, officials have also suggested a more gradual approach, with a shock tax increase followed by smaller annual increases.\n\nThe proposal has raised concerns about the potential for a black market to emerge, with Prime Minister John Key stating that the government is looking at a range of policies to stop smoking and huge price hikes could fuel black market trading. Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia has taken a more pragmatic approach, saying she has a \"whatever-it-takes\" attitude to the idea.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has released a briefing paper outlining various pricing scenarios, including a 10% increase on a pack of 20 cigarettes year-on-year from 2013 to 2025, which would see the cost of a packet rise to $40 by 2024. Another scenario would see packs reach $100 by 2020 through a shock rise of 30% to 60%, followed by annual increases of 30%.\n\nThe government is also considering other measures to reduce smoking, including regulating tobacco as a highly toxic substance, banning smoking in cars with children, doubling anti-smoking media campaigns, and removing tobacco from duty-free sale.
