He completed his 702-mile trek on Christmas Day, more than 12 days ahead of schedule. Sears, brother-in-law of tennis star Andy Murray, spent five weeks navigating the Antarctic plateau, crevasse fields, and glaciers.\n\nThe journey was not without its challenges. Sears faced 150mph winds and temperatures of -50c, and at one point, he hit a wall with just 38km to go, feeling exhausted and unable to take another step. However, he persevered and continued on, fueled by juice, biltong, chocolate, and music on his iPod.\n\nSears' feat has raised over £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which were destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. He also raised awareness for the trust through his social media updates and blog posts during his expedition.\n\nSears' achievement has been recognized by his family, including Andy Murray's mother, Judy, who tweeted congratulations to him. Sears himself said that it will take a few weeks for the experience to sink in, and he is looking forward to a shower and a meal after his grueling journey.\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records has yet to confirm whether Sears' feat will make it into the record books, but his achievement is undoubtedly an impressive one.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten version of the summary in a more concise and formal tone:\n\n**Scott Sears Becomes Youngest Person to Reach South Pole Solo**\n\nLieutenant Scott Sears, a 27-year-old officer with the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, has successfully completed a 702-mile solo trek to the South Pole.

Scott Sears, 27, reached the South Pole on Monday, and he says he's the youngest person ever to do so solo, though Guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval, the BBC notes. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SOUTH POLE! Absolutely chuffed to pieces,\" he wrote on his blog, where he documented his unassisted adventure, which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph. Sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep \"within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat.\" Sears, whose sister, Kim, is married to the tennis star, describes a grueling expedition with icy, crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the \"iPod poltergeist\" would occasionally strike, causing his music player to stop working. He says he \"truly hit a wall\" on Christmas Eve, where \"everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step.'\" But he devoured some dried meat, juice, and chocolate and pushed through, even hanging up his stinky socks as \"makeshift stockings\" for Santa that night. Sears' message from Andy Murray's mom once he arrived at his destination: \"Well done Scott Sears.\" If Guinness confirms Sears' feat, he'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder, per the Telegraph.
