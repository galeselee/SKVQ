The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say.

Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently experiencing a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The decline is causing concern among scientists and conservation groups, as it is affecting not only the sardine population itself but also the predators that rely on it for food.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The council has also been criticized for not doing enough to address the decline, with some groups calling for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe decline of the sardine population is attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. This has repelled sardines and led to a decline in their numbers. Additionally, overfishing and a lack of understanding of the causes of the decline are also contributing to the problem.\n\nThe effects of the sardine decline are being felt throughout the ecosystem, with predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and seabirds struggling to find food. The decline is also having an economic impact on the fishing industry, with fishermen reporting low catches and financial losses.\n\nConservation groups are calling for action to protect the sardine population and the ecosystem as a whole. They argue that the decline of the sardine population is a warning sign of a larger problem and that urgent action is needed to address the issue.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

This move is seen as a major step forward in the global fight against climate change, as it encourages other countries to set their own ambitious emissions reduction targets and paves the way for a strong global climate agreement in 2015.\n\nThe US has committed to reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, with a goal of transforming its economy and achieving 80% emissions reductions by 2050. This target builds on the country's existing goal of reducing emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, which is on track to be met.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. The country has also committed to expanding the share of its energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20% by 2030, which will require the development of up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind, and solar.\n\nThe joint announcement by the US and China is seen as a significant milestone in the US-China relationship and a major step forward in global climate diplomacy.

The average tax per worker has increased by 78% in Virginia, with some states facing increases of over $1,000 per worker.\n\nThe crisis is attributed to a record 20 million Americans collecting unemployment benefits last year, with 25 states borrowing over $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. Nine more states are expected to borrow by mid-year. The situation is deteriorating fast, with many states' trust funds dwindling rapidly.\n\nTo make up for the shortfall, states are implementing measures such as raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors. For example, Virginia has increased the average tax on employers to $171 per worker, while Hawaii's employers face an average increase of $1,070 per worker. Some states are also cutting benefits for the unemployed, with Pennsylvania workers receiving 2.3% less in benefits starting this month.\n\nEconomists warn that these measures may contribute to joblessness, rather than stimulating the economy. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\"\n\nThe crisis has also led to benefit cuts for seniors, with some states cutting benefits by as much as a third.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy during the late afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which is when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time when their own usage surges and when the utility company needs the most help.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during peak demand by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This reduction in peak demand could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes.\n\nThe study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, as it opens up the solar market to every homeowner who doesn't have significant shading issues. It also means that homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels, even if they do have a south-facing roof, especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours.\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, it's important to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's hard to predict what the outcome would be if the same study were conducted during the winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked debate among solar panel installers and utility companies. Some solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while, but utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb and refuse to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and gruel. His teeth were also heavily worn from chewing and using them as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that killed one of his front teeth, as well as a broken molar that may have been caused by a small stone in his food. The researchers suggest that the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time period may be linked to the uptick in starches in the diet.\n\nIn addition to his dental issues, Ötzi's genome was also sequenced, revealing a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite his hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

However, subsequent visits failed to find more of the species, and it was assumed to be extinct.\n\nResearchers from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Mexico's Ecology Institute, led by Daniel Mulcahy and Juan Martinez Gomez, embarked on an expedition to the island last May to search for the snake.

According to a new study, the ice sheet has lost nearly 84 billion tons of ice per year from 1992 to 2011, but this rate has increased to over 241 billion tons per year from 2012 to 2017. This melting has contributed to a rise in global sea levels of about 3mm since 1992.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, used 24 different methods to assess ice loss in Antarctica, including satellite data, ground measurements, and computer simulations. The researchers found that the melting is occurring mainly in West Antarctica, where most of the ice is floating on the ocean. The study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, warned that if the current trend continues, Antarctica could contribute up to 50cm to sea level rise by the end of the century.\n\nThe melting is attributed to warmer ocean waters, which are causing the ice sheets to melt from below. The warming of the southern ocean is linked to global warming, which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The study's findings are consistent with other research that has shown that Antarctica's ice sheet is losing mass at an accelerating rate.\n\nThe study's authors emphasized that the situation is dire and that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the rate of global warming. The melting of Antarctica's ice sheet is a major concern because it could have significant impacts on global sea levels and coastal communities.\n\nIn related news, another study published in Nature found that the East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2-5 million years ago when carbon dioxide levels were similar to those today. This suggests that the current melting of Antarctica's ice sheet is likely driven by human activities and not natural variability.\n\nOverall, the studies highlight the urgent need for action to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of global warming on Antarctica's ice sheet and the world's oceans.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is one page long:\n\nThe melting of Antarctica's ice sheet is accelerating at an alarming rate, with about 3 trillion tons of ice disappearing since 1992.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4511}
