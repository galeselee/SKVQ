According to Jennifer Allyn, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, what girls need now is encouragement to become leaders and a deeper understanding of what leadership entails.\n\nThe solution lies in taking girls to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, and introducing them to female role models who can inspire and mentor them. Companies can achieve this by shifting their focus on Take Our Children to Work Day to include female leaders, providing opportunities for girls to interact with them, and highlighting their accomplishments. This can help close the gap in leadership aspirations between girls and boys, as a recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80 percent of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60 percent have not been offered the opportunity.\n\nMoreover, companies need to provide sponsorship initiatives, which provide opportunities and support to female protégés, rather than just mentorship.

The team, led by Xavier Nieto Prieto, former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, examined the wreck and found that the artefacts found at the site were from a ship from a much later period, likely from the 17th or 18th century. The ship, which was discovered by US marine archaeologist Barry Clifford in May, was initially believed to be the Santa Maria, but Unesco experts have now ruled out this possibility.\n\nThe Unesco team found that the ship's fasteners were made of copper alloy, whereas the Santa Maria would have had iron and/or wood fixations. They also concluded that the site where the wreck was found was further away from the shore than expected, and that the ship's construction techniques and materials were inconsistent with those of the Santa Maria.\n\nThe discovery has sparked controversy, with some experts disagreeing with Unesco's findings. Professor Charles Beeker, a US underwater archaeologist, believes that the site is still the best candidate for the Santa Maria's wreck and that a more thorough investigation is needed. He also criticized Unesco's ideas about the ship's location, saying that it would have been impossible for the Santa Maria to drift onto land.\n\nThe Santa Maria was the flagship of Columbus's three-vessel fleet that discovered the New World.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the antifreeze proteins found in Antarctic notothenioid fish. These proteins, which prevent the fish's blood from freezing in the freezing waters of Antarctica, have been found to also inhibit the melting of ice crystals inside the fish's bodies. This means that the fish may never be able to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which could potentially cause life-threatening problems.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of marine biologists who studied the fish's behavior and physiology in their natural habitat. They found that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. This means that the fish's bodies may become superheated, with the ice crystals remaining intact even at temperatures above the expected melting point.\n\nThe researchers also found that the ice crystals accumulate in the fish's spleens, and it is possible that the fish have evolved a mechanism to filter them out of their circulation. However, the long-term cost of this adaptation is still unknown, and it is possible that the fish may be vulnerable to the accumulation of ice crystals in their bodies.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of evolution and the adaptation of species to their environments. It shows that every evolutionary innovation comes with unintended consequences, and that species may have to adapt to these consequences in order to survive.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and provides new insights into the biology and ecology of Antarctic notothenioid fish.

This means that the fish may never be able to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which could cause life-threatening problems.\n\nThe researchers found that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or shrink. The ice crystals accumulate in the fish's spleens, and it is possible that the fish have evolved a mechanism to filter them out of their circulation.\n\nThe study highlights the unintended consequences of evolutionary adaptations and the challenges", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

The Pacific Fishery Management Council, responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, is being urged to take action to protect the sardine population.\n\nThe council is being asked to set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and to fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of sardines has already had a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many predators, including brown pelicans, sea lions, and other marine mammals, struggling to find food.\n\nScientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but natural climate cycles and overfishing are both being considered as possible factors. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a naturally occurring climate cycle, has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, which may be repelling sardines. Additionally, the sardine population has been heavily exploited in the past, and the current decline may be a result of a combination of these factors.\n\nThe decline of sardines has significant economic and environmental implications. Forage fish, including sardines, account for over one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are worth billions of dollars when left in the water.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift.

Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1889}

Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The crisis is attributed to a combination of skyrocketing unemployment and poor planning by some states.\n\nAccording to a report by ProPublica, a non-profit newsroom, the average business owner in the US will pay higher unemployment taxes this year, with some states increasing taxes by as much as 200%. For example, in Virginia, the average tax on employers will increase to $171 from $95 per employee, while in Hawaii, employers will pay an average of $1,070 per worker.\n\nThe crisis has been exacerbated by the recession, which has left 5.5 million Americans collecting state jobless benefits. As a result, 25 states have borrowed over $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks flowing. Nine more states are expected to borrow by mid-year.\n\nThe tax increases and benefit cuts are expected to have a negative impact on the economy, as they may discourage employers from hiring and could lead to further joblessness. Economists argue that the measures undermine the purpose of the unemployment insurance system, which is to stimulate the economy during times of economic downturn.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for seniors, who are being hit with benefit cuts. In Virginia, for example, seniors will see their monthly benefits cut by as much as $190, while in Hawaii, the maximum benefit is being reduced by as much as a third.\n\nThe crisis is attributed to poor planning by some states, which failed to maintain adequate trust funds to cover unemployment benefits.

The Clarion nightsnake, a long, dark-spotted snake, was first discovered in 1936 by American naturalist William Beebe on the Pacific island of Clarion. However, subsequent searches failed to find any more individuals, and the species was largely forgotten.\n\nThe rediscovery was made by a team of researchers led by Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, and Juan Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands. The team used Beebe's original field notes as a guide and conducted DNA analysis to confirm the species' existence.\n\nThe Clarion nightsnake is found exclusively on the island and is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast, over 500 miles away. The team believes that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey to the island on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also because of the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands are inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines, and the island's ecosystem is vulnerable to external threats.\n\nThe National Museum of Natural History has recognized the Clarion nightsnake as a full species, and the team plans to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the island's ecosystem.

The virus is spread through direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids, or contaminated surfaces.\n\n**Quarantine and Testing**\n\nAbout 80 people who came into contact with the victim have been quarantined, including 60 healthcare workers.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap.

These compounds are thought to originate from the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids and esters, which are derived from the reaction of acids with alcohols.\n\nThe study also found that nitrogen-containing compounds, such as pyridine, are released during the decomposition of proteins and nucleic acids. Pyridine was previously detected in human and pig remains, and is thought to originate from niacin, a precursor of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP).\n\nThe researchers used a validated method of thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) to analyze the VOCs, and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the compounds that distinguish human and animal remains. The study found that pig remains could be separated from human remains based on five esters, and that human remains could be separated from other animal remains based on a combination of eight compounds.\n\nWhile the study has limitations, including the use of glass jars and the absence of environmental parameters, it is an important step in the search for human specific markers.

This ice loss has contributed to a global sea level rise of about 3/10 of an inch (7.6 mm) over the past quarter century.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 10 to 15 satellites, as well as ground and air measurements, and computer simulations, found that the melting is occurring at a rate that is not natural and is likely driven by climate change. The warming of the southern ocean, which is connected to global warming, is causing the melting of the ice sheets from below.\n\nThe study also found that the melting is not uniform, with West Antarctica losing more than 70% of its ice since 2012, while East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4511}

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The strike, which was carried out by two warships in the Mediterranean, targeted the Shayrat airbase in Homs, which was used as a base for Syrian jets allegedly involved in the chemical attack. The attack was the first direct military action taken by the US against the Syrian government, and was widely condemned by Russia and Iran, who are key allies of the Syrian government.\n\nThe US strike was in response to a chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province, which was carried out by the Syrian government. The attack was widely condemned by the international community, and the US, along with other countries, has called for the Syrian government to be held accountable for its actions.\n\nThe strike was carried out by two warships, the USS Porter and the USS Ross, which fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at the airbase. The strike caused significant damage to the base, and at least three Syrian soldiers and several civilians were killed. The US military has said that it did not know if there were any Russian troops at the base, but took steps to avoid harming them.\n\nThe strike was widely supported by the international community, with many countries, including the UK, France, and Australia, welcoming the move. However, Russia and Iran have condemned the strike, with Russia calling it an \"act of aggression\" and Iran saying it was a \"dangerous and destructive\" move.\n\nThe US has said that it will continue to take action against the Syrian government if it continues to use chemical weapons, and has called on other countries to join it in taking action. The strike has raised tensions between the US and Russia, and has created uncertainty about the future of the US-Russia relationship.\n\nThe strike has also raised questions about the role of the US in the Syrian conflict, and whether it will continue to play a major role in the conflict. The US has been involved in the conflict since 2014, when it began targeting the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. However, the strike on the Syrian government has marked a significant shift in the US's role in the conflict.\n\nOverall, the US missile strike on the Syrian airbase has marked a significant escalation in the conflict, and has raised tensions between the US and Russia.

Republicans including Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee, meanwhile, were joined by Democrats such as Sen. Tim Kaine in slamming Trump for launching the strikes without congressional approval.

A statement from the Syrian military denounced the strike as \"blatant aggression\" that will be a setback to its \"counterterrorist\" activity. Deutsche Welle reports that the attack was endorsed by European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Bashar al-Assad bears \"sole responsibility\" for the strike against his regime's forces. Russia's military says only 23 out of the 59 American missiles reached the Shayrat airbase in Homs province, the AP reports. The military says the attack destroyed six Syrian planes, but left the runway intact. Vladimir Putin has denounced the strike as American aggression, a spokesman says. The New York Times looks at the risks and opportunities the strike has opened up for Trump. There's now an opportunity for the US to demand that Russia help get rid of Assad—but there's the risk Putin might reject any such deal, that the strike could hurt the fight against ISIS, and that Trump's team has no real plan for peace in Syria. Syrian opposition groups welcomed the attack and said they hoped it marked the beginning of a wider campaign against Assad. \"For Syrians, any military intervention that will neutralize Assad’s ability to continue his genocide will fall on our hearts like music,\" a civil defense volunteer in northern Syria tells the Los Angeles Times.

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia. North Korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \"video chatting\" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \"I felt so disgusting,\" Suh says. And it's what led Suh (who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her, but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind) and the two other women to try to escape once more—this time to Laos, then to Thailand, where they wouldn't have been able to be repatriated back to North Korea.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends.

The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts.

The initial greeting was a friendly one, with Trump grasping the arm of his fellow world leader during the handshake. (See the video.) \"We will have a terrific relationship,\" Trump told reporters shortly after the greeting, reports USA Today. Kim, for his part, said \"it has not been easy to get here,\" adding that \"the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles, but we have overcome them and we are here today,\" per the Guardian. After the ceremonial introduction, the two men met with only their interpreters in tow, then walked together along a balcony as they headed to a larger meeting with aides. Trump told reporters from the balcony that the meeting was \"very, very good\" and predicted he and Kim \"will solve a big problem, a big dilemma,\" reports the AP. It was difficult to hear the two men, but the AP adds that Kim appeared to agree with the optimism. White House officials have been downplaying the idea that a major breakthrough will result from the historic meeting on Sentosa Island. Instead, the big hope is that the summit will lead to a blueprint for negotiators from both countries to follow that would lead to denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

In 2014, a hacker took control of a wind farm, changing a critical setting that could have damaged the generator and destabilized the nearby grid.\n\nThe grid's vulnerabilities are attributed to its aging infrastructure, with some equipment running on outdated software and hardware. Many control systems are not connected to the internet, but those that are can be accessed through unsecured networks. Smart meters, which are increasingly being used to monitor electricity usage, are particularly vulnerable to hacking.\n\nDespite the risks, the government and energy companies are taking steps to improve cybersecurity.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training. But parents should know the dangers: \"Until proven otherwise,\" a lawyer tells Flanagan, \"they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in.\" Click for her full piece."], "all_classes": null, "length": 13444}

The most severe form is FAS, which is characterized by facial abnormalities, growth deficiency, and central nervous system damage. FASD is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure and can result in a range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive problems.\n\n**Prevalence and Risk Factors**\n\nFASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. The risk of FASD increases with the amount and frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure. Women who drink large quantities of alcohol during pregnancy are at a higher risk of giving birth to a child with FASD.\n\n**History and Recognition**\n\nFAS was first identified and named in 1973 by Dr. Kenneth Lyons Jones and Dr. David Weyhe Smith. Prior to this, there were anecdotal accounts of links between maternal alcohol use and negative child outcomes, but no specific syndrome was recognized. The discovery of FAS led to a greater understanding of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and the development of diagnostic criteria.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of FASD vary in severity and can include facial abnormalities, growth deficiency, and central nervous system damage. Diagnosis is based on a combination of physical examination, medical history, and behavioral observations. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" is used to assess the severity of FASD.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nThere is no known cure for FASD, but early interventions and supportive services can help mitigate the effects of the disorder. Prevention is key, and women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant are advised to abstain from alcohol or consume it in moderation.\n\n**Celebrity News**\n\nReality TV star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi has spoken out about her own experiences with drinking and partying, admitting that she may occasionally overdo it.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Surprisingly, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with their lives, suggesting that locked-in syndrome may not be the living hell that many assume it to be.

Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology.

A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system. Aran Khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in Harvard's Technology Science journal. \"From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app,\" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site.

{"pred": "Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has introduced a new \"Medicare for all\" health care bill, which aims to provide comprehensive health care services to all Americans. The bill, which has been endorsed by nearly a third of the Senate Democratic caucus, would eliminate premiums, deductibles, and co-pays for private health insurance, and instead require Americans to pay a smaller share of their income to fund the program. The plan would also allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices and would not cover long-term care, which would be addressed in separate legislation.\n\nThe bill has been praised by progressive activists and some Democratic lawmakers, who see it as a step towards creating a more equitable and affordable health care system. However, the plan is likely to face significant opposition from Republicans, who have repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and have expressed concerns about the cost and feasibility of a single-payer system.\n\nThe bill's introduction comes at a time when public support for single-payer health care is increasing, with 53% of Americans now backing the idea, according to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Some Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand, have already announced their support for the bill, which could potentially become a central issue in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe plan's financing mechanism has not been fully explained, but Sanders has said that the government would need to raise taxes to fund the program. The bill would phase out the current system over a four-year transition period, starting with adding dental, vision, and hearing aid coverage to Medicare, and then gradually expanding eligibility to all Americans.\n\nWhile the bill is unlikely to pass in its current form, it marks a significant shift in the national conversation about health care and could potentially pave the way for future reforms.assistant\n\nHere is a rewritten summary that is one page long:\n\nBernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has introduced a new \"Medicare for all\" health care bill that aims to provide comprehensive health care services to all Americans.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

Seriously. The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

They said the information about the CIA's technological capabilities is unsurprising, but that it should serve as a reminder to people that they cannot fully trust the security of their devices. \"People need to wake up to the fact that they need to take responsibility for maintaining the privacy of their information and make no assumptions,\" says Ajay Arora, CEO of Vera. \"At the end of the day, no one has your best interests in mind but you—people can't even trust their own government anymore. This is the tragic new normal we have to all unfortunately accept.\" Companies including Google, Samsung, and WhatsApp declined to comment, the Washington Post reports. Apple released a statement saying the issues disclosed in the leak were patched in a recent update and that they \"always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security update.\" \"Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV. That's today,\" tweeted Edward Snowden, though he added that while it may not feel like it, end-to-end encryption has actually made computer security a lot better than it used to be."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10705}

He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \"rushed to the exits\" at the thought of Obama's move.

For example: Jan Brewer called it a \"victory for the rule of law,\" and for the 10th Amendment, because \"the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented,\" meaning the provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other crimes. Joe Arpaio agreed. \"I think this is a good section that's been upheld,\" he said, though he lamented the loss of \"the authority to arrest illegal aliens just by being there illegally.\" President Obama said he was also \"pleased\" with the decision, which \"makes unmistakably clear (that) Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform,\" but said he was still \"concerned\" about the remaining provision, according to CNN.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life.

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older.
